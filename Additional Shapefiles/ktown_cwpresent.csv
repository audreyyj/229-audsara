not all apartment communities are created equal. to stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. first, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. so what makes valley street apartments special?<br/>
when you come home to valley st. apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. you'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/>
<br/>
you'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of echo park and silver lake. our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic los angeles landmarks, and so much more. and with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/>
<br/>
maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. if so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

not all apartment communities are created equal. to stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. first, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. so what makes valley street apartments special?<br/><br/>
when you come home to valley st. apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. you'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/><br/>
you'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of echo park and silver lake. our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic los angeles landmarks, and so much more. and with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/><br/>
maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. if so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. contact us online or by phone today.

not all apartment communities are created equal. to stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. first, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. so what makes valley street apartments special?<br/>
when you come home to valley st. apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. you'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/>
<br/>
you'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of echo park and silver lake. our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic los angeles landmarks, and so much more. and with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/>
<br/>
maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. if so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

<br/><br/>not all apartment communities are created equal. to stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. first, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. so what makes valley street apartments special?<br/><br/>
when you come home to valley st. apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. you'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/><br/>
you'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of echo park and silver lake. our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic los angeles landmarks, and so much more. and with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/><br/>
maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. if so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

hi everyone. looking for a new roommate for my one bedroom with a loft. i live upstairs in my open loft next to the 2nd story balcony. the bedroom is private with it's own bathroom, but it is unfurnished. my stove, fridge, and microwave can be shared and i will be paying for all utility bills. rent will be $1000, but i may be willing to lower it (slightly). <br/>
<br/>
little about me, i am a poc, lgbt friendly, and extremely friendly (can be opinionated though). i try to live by the 3 ""c's"" (cool, calm, and collected :-) . i work in the entertainment field, but jobs have been slow in the last year. when i start back i likely will be working from home again, so i will be their most of the time. looking for a chill person, that keeps the common areas clean, don't have many guests, and has no kids (sorry bad experience with a roomy). i prefer someone in their 20's and 30's, but definitely open to older or younger.<br/>
<br/>
a credit check and application are required by the property management, so please be prepared. if you have any more questions feel free to ask me at the provided number (text only) or email. i will only be accepting text and emails until we see if we're a match. thanks for reading the ad and hope it wasn't to long :-)<br/>

ultimately, home is all about the details. for an apartment home to be unique, it needs more than just a reasonable amount of living space; it needs amenities that enrich your life, in a place that enhances your experiences. at grandview towers, those details are our priority.<br/>
<br/>
as you explore your new apartment home, you'll notice a wide variety of thoughtful amenities. look up and you'll see soaring vaulted ceilings, which create a feeling of space. look down and you'll see immaculate hardwood and tile flooring. run your hand along smooth granite countertops, and your eye can't help but wander to stainless steel appliances.<br/>
<br/>
just steps away lies our fitness center, providing plenty of opportunities to help sustain your busy lifestyle. look a little further at immaculately kept landscaping, where you can mingle and meet new friends and old. look further yet, and you'll see you're surrounded by the diverse and laid-back community of westlake. parks, restaurants, and museums are available, and you're less than two minutes from downtown los angeles.<br/>
<br/>
home is all about the details. if you're ready to take advantage of them, we're ready to have you. for more information about leasing, contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

not all apartment communities are created equal. to stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. first, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. so what makes valley street apartments special?<br/><br/>
when you come home to valley st. apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. you'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/><br/>
you'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of echo park and silver lake. our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic los angeles landmarks, and so much more. and with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/><br/>
maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. if so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. contact us online or by phone today.
