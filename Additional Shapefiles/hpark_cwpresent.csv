the unit is a side unit addition to the main house. the unit has its own private entry, parking space with gate (featured in photos) and only shares one wall with the main house. there is a shared laundry and dryer on site.<br/>
<br/>
renters in the side unit would live as neighbors to us (we are also renters and live in the main house). we are a couple in our 30's with a 2 year old boy. we love the location, space, and having our family here. we are looking for a single person (or couple) who will be a respectful and friendly neighbor and easy to communicate with about our shared space. the property is smoke free (cigarettes). <br/>
<br/>
the side unit for rent has one large living room with a large closet, full bathroom, and kitchen, and one large bedroom with: 2 closets, a private full bathroom, and a side nook with a window which could be used for a office/desk.  it's very spacious for a single person but has been occupied by a couple as well.  the property as a whole has a front and back yard, with lovely trees and flowers.  the photo's featured have the current tenants belongings. the space is not furnished. <br/>
<br/>
located in a prime area of highland park, this side unit is on a quiet residential street, but is extremely close to shops/coffee/yoga/bars/highland park theater on figueroa st. it is also a short walk (1/2 mile) to the gold line metro and dash bus. it is 10 minutes to downtown by car and less than 15 minutes by train. we use the train all the time.  additionally, ernest debs regional park is right in our backyard and only a short walk to the trails up the hills of the park. <br/>
<br/>
rent for the side unit is $1850 per month (+ 1 month deposit). this does not include utilities, which are split between the main house and side unit. the unit is available for move-in july 1st, but could be made available sooner if needed. <br/>
<br/>
please email with a little bit of information about yourself, including what type of living situation you are looking for, what you do for work in los angeles, your age, and whether or not you are seeking the unit for yourself or as a couple. let us know if you have any questions. we will email you back to set up a time to view the unit.<br/>

this old world styled italian built duplex sits at the rear of a large lot. there is a shared front yard perfect for gardening. there is a shared driveway for 3 cars. <br/>
there is a nice hilltop breeze. unit is very private and comes clean with fresh paint.<br/>
it has a historic kitchen and bathroom.<br/>
tenants to the right side are very quiet and peaceful. we would like to retain this calmness in the spirit of peace.  <br/>
<br/>
this is a very safe community with many different ethnicities and age groups.<br/>
this unit is literally less than 1 mile from downtown, best described by its landmarks, chinatown to the left, echo park to the right, dodger stadium behind and downtown in front.<br/>
there are a number of wild peacocks that live on the hill.<br/>
we prefer a non-smoker willing to sign a one year lease.<br/>

on the best street in the lower hollywood hills, surrounded by classic spanish style homes, near  wattles estate and park. a midcentury one story home, upgraded , private. our wonderful tenants of 11 years bought a home, and are moving out may 28. it will be ready for you to move in june 01, 2021.<br/>
<br/>
$3,950 for one adult add $250/month for a second adult. two is the limit.  young scholars are welcome,<br/>
no extra fee. gardner street skool is a few blocks away (that was michael jackson's school.)<br/>
<br/>
country living in the middle of hollywood, green and quiet yet close to all.<br/>
best location in the lower hollywood hills. we know, because the two co-owners/landlords<br/>
have their homes a block away, been living here for decades. <br/>
your future home is surrounded by a tall wooden fence. private and quiet.<br/>
at the back there is  a 1+ 1 wing, but this is all one house.  you only share the laundry room. the other tenant is<br/>
a mature, single man, no noise, no parties.<br/>
our street is in the lower hollywood hills, [above hollywood blvd., halfway between fairfax and la brea] on a quiet, cul de sac street of vintage spanish style homes. green views of the surrounding hills, hardly any traffic, yet walk just one long block to a bus stop, two more blocks get you to shops and restaurants on sunset blvd., a longer walk to hollywood and highland, restaurants, shopping, markets, metro station, kodak-dolby, and el capitan theaters, clubs (when they re-open soon) .. hiking trails in the hill above you ....<br/>
our dead end little canyon was subdivided in the 1920s, and has been a favorite of hollywood folks since then.  the home directly across the street was russ columbo's (**).<br/>
several other names lived around here, and in this house too. (who? it is bad form to drop names, as i was told by george clooney).<br/>
<br/>
looking for one or two responsible, quiet persons, with good refs.,<br/>
non [indoors] smoking. perfect for work from home, (it has a huge office/studio).<br/>
<br/>
front and side fenced yards.  as you enter, to one side the living room with hardwood floor, a wood burning fireplace. to the other side, the dining room. a corridor runs to the back of the house. on one side,<br/>
the kitchen is large, tile floor, upgraded cabinets.<br/>
next is the master bathroom, all tiled, with a skylight, and the main bedroom, hardwood floor, large<br/>
closet, and a door to the side yard and the laundry room.<br/>
on the other side of the corridor- bedroom #2, bedroom #3, bathroom #2, and at the end a 400 sq. foot<br/>
studio/office/ work room, all tiled floor, direct exits to the side yards.<br/>
use it for anything that is not noisy ( no loud music, no loud power tools etc.)<br/>
<br/>
there is a beautiful and little known city park across the street.[the wattles mansion estate. google it.].<br/>
green hills views all around. hiking/jogging roads and trails just above the house. join your landlady and a neighbor on their morning walks).<br/>
<br/>

</div>
hey y'all!<br/>
<br/>
looking to fill a room in a great apartment in montecito heights starting june 1st. 1 year lease preferred.<br/>
<br/>
about the apartment: <br/>
- 3br/2ba<br/>
- lower level, off-street unit in a 3 unit triplex <br/>
- fully remodeled in 2018 with new flooring, appliances, and fixtures<br/>
- 1 group of tenants since remodel<br/>
- high ceilings, tons of natural light<br/>
- 3 off-street parking spots<br/>
- central ac/heating<br/>
- large outdoor space (currently with picnic table, potted garden, and grill) <br/>
- friendly, quiet neighbors<br/>
<br/>
about the room:<br/>
rent: $900/mo + wifi/utilities ($60-90/mo depending on ac use)<br/>
- 12’ x 9’<br/>
- larger of the two secondary bedrooms<br/>
- nw facing windows w/ abundant afternoon light<br/>
- bathroom shared with one person<br/>
<br/>
pros:<br/>
- 12 mins to usc's health sciences campus (lac+usc, keck hospital) at all hours <br/>
- great offsite landlord who promptly responds to issues<br/>
- pet friendly! 2 friendly cats in residence currently, will consider additional pets<br/>
- 5 minutes to bars/eateries in highland park on figueroa <br/>
- a short walk to: debs regional park, sycamore grove park, and a large grocery store<br/>
close to the 110: short drive to pasadena, dtla, echo park, and silver lake<br/>
<br/>
cons:<br/>
- no washer/dryer. however, there is a laundromat a 1/2 block away so if you can make the trek this place might be for you. <br/>
<br/>
about the roommates:<br/>
#1: 29 year old medical student at usc. i work a lot and like the home to be a place a relax and recharge, and occasionally host a few friends. when not working i like getting outdoors to hike, ski, hit the beach, or golf. always searching for the next great la sandwich. recently tried: the blta at spoke bicycle cafe, highly recommended.<br/>
<br/>
#2: early 30s attorney. i like to run, hike, and be active. i work both at home and in the office but am quiet. i'm always up for trying out a new brewery, restaurant, or attempting a new recipe. i have 2 friendly cats.<br/>
<br/>
about you:<br/>
- organized with your bills (i.e. employed or student)<br/>
- generally respectful of personal space and others' work schedules<br/>
- not an aspiring dj after 10pm at night<br/>
<br/>
if you're interested please send an email with a bit about yourself. if it seems like a good match we'll reach out to set up a showing. thanks!<br/>
<br/>
happy to send a video tour or additional pics of the home in its lived-in state, if desired.    </section>", (Montecito Heights),$900,3.0,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-room-available-in-3br-2ba/7325583167.html,34.093998,-118.207612,POINT (-118.207612 34.093998),art,True

hi there! looking for a woman to fill a room in my 2 bedroom/2 bathroom apartment in hlp. the apartment is very close to fig which has a of fun bars, coffee shops, and restaurants but far enough to still feel like a home-y neighbor. i’m 28 years old female and have two very friendly cats, so if you like cats this place is for you.<br/>
<br/>
i’m looking for someone down to earth and responsible. if you want to grab an occasional drink or hang, i’m there! but i’m also respectful of your space! also living room needs to be furnished since my roommate just moved out. happy to do that with you or i will absolutely take care of it. <br/>

hello! i am moving into a new home soon (june/july) in the highland park/eagle rock area. i’m looking for a partner or two who might be interested in sharing a back house recording studio. for example, you may be someone who would want to have access to a studio a couple days a week, say saturdays and sundays, but you don’t want to rent a space full-time. or you might be a producer/songwriter who works from their apartment who could benefit from a more professional space some of the time. <br/>
<br/>
if that sounds like you, reach out! if someone comes on board before i build out a space, it’s a great opportunity to offer your input to craft the space into something that works for both of us. my aesthetics are classic studio vibes, minimal-ish. not like a dark cave - something creativity inducing.<br/>
<br/>
i am a freelance recording engineer/producer, and have lots of great gear/instruments that you will have access to (assuming they are treated with care). neumann tube mic, aea ribbon mic, dynamic mics, altec preamp, bae neve preamp, adam a77x speakers, ns10mm speakers, teac tape machine, digital mellotron, roland jupiter synth, hohner pianet (like rhodes/wurlitzer), roland ju-06, critter &amp; guitari synths, m-audio code49 midi controller, apollo with tons of uad plugins, ultrawide computer monitor, vintage electric and acoustic guitars + basses, and more. tbd if i will be putting drums in the space.<br/>
<br/>
for two 4-hour blocks per week: $400/month.<br/>
for three 4-hour blocks per week: $580/month.<br/>
for two 8-hour blocks per week: $700/month.<br/>
for three 8-hour blocks per week: $900/month.<br/>
<br/>
i am slightly flexible on price, depending on your schedule and what (if any) gear of your own you’d like to add to the studio to share.<br/>
<br/>
space is very limited. i am looking for one or two people max. studio will be available to work in by mid july at the latest.<br/>
<br/>
the attached photo is of my former studio which was also shared, the location of the new studio will be in a standalone converted garage (with windows/power/air conditioning).<br/>
<br/>
if you are interested, please reach out, tell me a bit about you, and i will send you some simple application questions to learn more about you and your studio needs. thanks for looking!    </section>", (Los Angeles),$400,,300.0,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/wst/roo/d/los-angeles-backhouse-recording-studio/7318521995.html,34.1235,-118.2182,POINT (-118.2182 34.1235),art,True

hello, the room will be opening june 1st, and is located in a beautiful and picturesque highland park hill-house complete with views and private outdoor space/collective parking. <br/>
<br/>
the room itself is long and large enough to be both a bedroom and a music studio (that's what i did there for a year), and has it's own entrance, outside hang area, 1/2 bath. and of course comes along with access to the amazing house with central heat/ac, private outdoor space (a small putting green), washer dryer, and views a plenty. the other two housemates are two male songwriters/artists in their 30's, live upstairs from the studio, and are respectful and cleanly. <br/>
<br/>
1700$ a month plus utilities, first and deposit due up front. open to shorter stays but would prefer someone looking for a year lease to start.    </section>", (Highland Park),"$1,700",3.0,300.0,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-huge-bedroom-studio-with/7324949419.html,34.1145,-118.1929,POINT (-118.1929 34.1145),private,True

about the room:<br/>
the room has a large closet and two windows. you will be sharing a bathroom with another roommate (she is very clean and respectful). please note the room will not be furnished. there is a 6-month minimum lease, which will then roll over to month-to-month.<br/>
<br/>
about the house:<br/>
the house is a 3br/2ba craftsman in the heart of highland park. there is a washer/dryer in the unit and plenty of parking on the residential streets (not at all like hollywood where parking is a nightmare). the house is fully furnished but please note, the room itself is unfurnished. there is also a separate guest house in the back where there is also a tenant - so a total of three rooms in the house and one more in the separate back house.<br/>
<br/>
location<br/>
we are located 1 block from the popular york blvd where there are plenty of shops, restaurants, and nightlife. there is a supermarket called super a, a 5 min walk away. there is also a trader joe’s, sprouts, target and vons about a 5 min drive away. we are also 5 mins from figueroa st and colorado blvd where there are plenty of shops, restaurants, etc.<br/>
<br/>
current roommates:<br/>
we are women in our early-mid 30s. our careers vary from bioresearch to film. we all work full time and both work remotely and onsite at this point (we are also fully vaccinated! woo!) a must for any new addition is that they are drama-free, reliable with bills and respectful of communal spaces as we have a very harmonious environment in the house.<br/>
<br/>
pets:<br/>
there is a 12lb senior dog in the guest house and a 35lb dog in the house so you must be dog-friendly. they are both calm, well behaved, and trained. but unfortunately, we cannot have any additional pets.    </section>", (Highland Park),"$1,200",,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-bedroom-available-in/7322036386.html,34.1145,-118.1929,POINT (-118.1929 34.1145),art,True

in brief: beautiful, spacious, centrally located, recently renovated, 1602 square foot house with 5 bed rooms / offices, 3 bathrooms, nest-controlled central ac, dishwasher, washer/dryer, skylight, etc. available for rent june 1 or june 15.  (could also rent it with only 4 bedrooms for $600 less, see below).<br/>
i can show it most days, with 24+ hour notice.  please send me day(s)/time(s) that work for you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
full description: <br/>
large, ~1602 sqft, 2-story home featuring a large kitchen with skylight / breakfast bar / 5-burner gas stove / stainless steel dishwasher, lots of natural light through double pane windows for energy efficiency and noise reduction, and nest controlled central ac (air-conditioning) and heating throughout (there are actually 2 full hvac systems, one for upstairs and one for downstairs each with its own nest thermostat you can control from your smartphone if you want to!), and the second floor features beautiful european oak hardwood flooring and views including hillsides (and a distant peek of the hollywood sign through the back bedroom window!).<br/>
<br/>
this home has 5 rooms that could be used as bedrooms, work form home offices, etc.  2 are king-sized rooms, two queen-sized rooms, and a full-size room (there's plenty of room for more than just the bed in these rooms! and you could easily fit a king bed in the queen rooms, there just might not be room for nightstands on both sides of the bed if you do!). <br/>
1 king, 1 queen, and 1 full are upstairs as are 2 bathrooms (1 with bathtub, the other shower), + 1 king, 1 queen bedroom (with a large walk-in, being john malkovich closet) and 1 bathroom with shower on the ground floor. <br/>
<br/>
great location near 3 parks (including soccer fields, tennis courts, basketball hoops), the la river / bike path, public transit (nearby buses to downtown la, burbank, etc. + a gold line metro stop just 0.8 mi away), and short drives / uber / lyft to dtla, echo park, silverlake, dodger stadium, highland park, glassell park, mt. washington, chinatown, little tokyo, silver lake reservoir, etc. etc.  ~3 minute drive to the closest 2 super markets, or ~10 minutes to trader joe's, sprouts, or whole foods.<br/>
<br/>
looking for responsible, financially qualified tenants for a 1 year lease.  security deposit equal to 1 month rent. <br/>
credit / background checks required, to be paid for by prospective tenants (after you've seen and liked the place of course).<br/>
owner pays water and sewer only. tenants responsible for gas, electric, etc.<br/>
no smoking / no vaping. no parking provided. no pets preferred.<br/>
<br/>
i may need 24 hours or more notice before showing the unit to you, depending on the current tenants' schedules.<br/>
<br/>
this home shares a lot with another detached house with a red wood fence separating the two houses. a small front yard with guava tree, citrus tree, and rose bushes is shared. a brick patio / terrace shaded by the large guava tree will be made in the next few months.  there's also small patio spaces on the side of and behind the house.<br/>
<br/>
there's a clothes washer dryer in a laundry room outside of the back of the house for your exclusive use.<br/>
<br/>
if you are only interested in renting the house as a 4-bedroom (for $600 less), i've been thinking of converting the 5th bedroom off the back of the house into an accessory dwelling space, which would have its own entrance and would be walled off from the rest of the house.  if this were to happen, the washer and dryer would be moved inside near the kitchen for you. <br/>

my ideal roommate would be someone who also thinks that a living space should be a clean and quiet sanctuary and who has lived with roommates before and is comfortable sharing a space and keeping it clean. pescetarian/vegetarian/vegan preferred. also, no couples, no overnight guests or full house all the time. i am looking for a someone who loves a positive vibe with a friendly living experience. please be open minded and a good communicator.<br/>

<br/>
this will be month to month but i am willing to do a 3 month lease first and if after 90 days we can sign a new lease for 6 months or a year.<br/>
<br/>
there's also a dog living with me. hes a shiba - he is very sweet and gentle and keeps to himself.<br/>

<br/>
basement: basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. it has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. doesn't have hvac at the moment.<br/>

broadway! the most up and coming street in dtla! area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. you want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  this building is also across the street from the roxie, cameo, &amp; arcade theaters! these are just three of the many historic theaters on broadway!  broadway was the original hollywood and stars like charlie chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. the spring arcade food hall is also located across the street. incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the bringing back broadway organization. only signage allowed on broadway is now neon! <br/>
<br/>
ground floor: has soaring ceilings!  there's central hvac along with windowed frontage and a metal roll-up door for security. space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. space can be used for any kind of permitted retail space or office space. space is ideal for an art gallery! other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! space has private bathroom! there's also 3 offices in the back! smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
basement: basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. it has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. doesn't have hvac at the moment.<br/>

broadway! the most up and coming street in dtla! area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. you want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  this building is also across the street from the roxie, cameo, &amp; arcade theaters! these are just three of the many historic theaters on broadway!  broadway was the original hollywood and stars like charlie chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. the spring arcade food hall is also located across the street. incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the bringing back broadway organization. only signage allowed on broadway is now neon! <br/>
<br/>
ground floor: has soaring ceilings!  there's central hvac along with windowed frontage and a metal roll-up door for security. space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. space can be used for any kind of permitted retail space or office space. space is ideal for an art gallery! other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! space has private bathroom! there's also 3 offices in the back! smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
basement: basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. it has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. doesn't have hvac at the moment.<br/>

amazing and beautiful custom-built gym/studio wit it all! a fortune has been spent on the improvements in this space!  previous tenant was a yoga studio and this space would be ideal for a peerspace tenant, yoga, pilates, dance, aerobics, and et cetera.  this would also be great for a personal trainer space, or maybe even a spa or salon! a regular gym could be okay, the only concern is the noise of dropping weights. right below this space is a food hall!  this space is located on the second floor of a brilliant creative office edifice in extremely coveted area of downtown la's fashion district literally right at the border of the historic core! located on 7th street &amp; spring street on gallery row, where most of the dtla artwalk occurs! space has a reception area along with a desk, 2 rooms/offices, two bathrooms, one with lockers and both with showers, and a huge open floor area!  there's beautiful polished cement floors throughout except in the bathrooms and studio area. the bathrooms have tile and the studio has nice high-end carpet.  there's 3 central hvac units with private thermostats along with 24/7 access! this is an a+ location! walking distance to tons of bars, cafes, &amp; restaurants! dtla's newest food hall is now open on the ground floor of this building! there's also a cool roof deck with a great view! get it now before someone else swoops it up! ask advantages of signing 5-year lease! all our listings, min 1 year leases but owner may require longer than 1 year. showings by appointment only. we are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn't meet your needs we may have something else that does! call/text 213-304-4727 now or submit the quick contact form on our website at dtla real estate.com and don't forget to follow us on social media at the links below, thank you!<br/>

broadway! the most up and coming street in dtla! area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. you want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  this building is also across the street from the roxie, cameo, &amp; arcade theaters! these are just three of the many historic theaters on broadway!  broadway was the original hollywood and stars like charlie chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. the spring arcade food hall is also located across the street. incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the bringing back broadway organization. only signage allowed on broadway is now neon! <br/>
<br/>
ground floor: has soaring ceilings!  there's central hvac along with windowed frontage and a metal roll-up door for security. space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. space can be used for any kind of permitted retail space or office space. space is ideal for an art gallery! other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! space has private bathroom! there's also 3 offices in the back! smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
basement: basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. it has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. doesn't have hvac at the moment.<br/>

newly renovated restaurant space for lease in south pasadena! the famous rialto theater has had a phenomenal facelift and the retail has undergone an amazing renovation! this stunning space has been freshly cleaned up and painted. the ceilings are an estimated 18′ high ceilings with large windows stretching to the ceiling! massive amounts of natural light flood this space, and what a beautiful space it is. it features an existing functioning vent/hood along with multiple sinks. there’s a countertop that opens from the kitchen/cooking area right into the space. infinite possibilities for restaurant/café spaces for this space. located in an excellent location with tons of drive-by traffic! as far as permits go, due diligence has yet to have been done regarding whether they are active or not. yet, for qualified lessee’s lessor may consider a free rent period if any permit work is needed. space features an ada size bathroom (lessee to verify) along with a small bathroom in the kitchen. there’s a second floor storage area as well that’s approximately 120sf, and is included in the quoted rent rate. i imagine a restaurant/café concept that does a lot of take-out and delivery would find this opportunity the most attractive since there is limited space for seating. get it before someone else comes and takes this hot opportunity off the market! showings by appointment only! we are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn’t meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does! please call/text 213-304-4727 now! thank you! and don’t forget to follow us on social media at the links below!<br/>
