hi everyone. looking for a new roommate for my one bedroom with a loft. i live upstairs in my open loft next to the 2nd story balcony. the bedroom is private with it's own bathroom, but it is unfurnished. my stove, fridge, and microwave can be shared and i will be paying for all utility bills. rent will be $1000, but i may be willing to lower it (slightly). <br/>
<br/>
little about me, i am a poc, lgbt friendly, and extremely friendly (can be opinionated though). i try to live by the 3 ""c's"" (cool, calm, and collected :-) . i work in the entertainment field, but jobs have been slow in the last year. when i start back i likely will be working from home again, so i will be their most of the time. looking for a chill person, that keeps the common areas clean, don't have many guests, and has no kids (sorry bad experience with a roomy). i prefer someone in their 20's and 30's, but definitely open to older or younger.<br/>
<br/>
a credit check and application are required by the property management, so please be prepared. if you have any more questions feel free to ask me at the provided number (text only) or email. i will only be accepting text and emails until we see if we're a match. thanks for reading the ad and hope it wasn't to long :-)<br/>
