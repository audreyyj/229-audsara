why pay silverlake prices. gillman apartments has a rare opening in our 1930s spanish style pet friendly building in east hollywood. just a few blocks from the metro at santa monica and vermont, our location is close to anywhere you need to go in los angeles.  we are aware of all the changes covid has brought over the past year, so we have set up sitting areas in the back, with table umbrella and string lights. we have also opened up the roof area with tables and chairs to view the skyline and the stars at night.  the unit itself has been updated with tile flooring, tile counter on new white kitchen cabinets refrigerator and stove, and an updated bathroom. unit 203 faces the north cooler side in the warm summer months quickly approaching.  come walk the property and see what this up and coming area has to offer.  these units go quick with all utilities included.  downside is street parking only, but by permit, so not as bad as many areas. you can also ask rebecca for ideas on how to approach other buildings in the area to get a parking spot.    </section>", (East Hollywood),"$1,495",,475.0,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/apa/d/los-angeles-east-hollywood-spanish/7324473114.html,34.091419,-118.297529,POINT (-118.297529 34.091419),art,True

available june 2, 2021.  here is an ideal apartment because of its modern and warm interior, reasonable priced, fine design, good location, and for the charm and character of the place. this one bedroom apartment with free satellite tv service, wireless internet (wi-fi) free, a washer and dryer in the unit, and of course free water, trash, gardening, and exterior lighting.<br/>
we are south of the prestigious kaiser permanente sunset blvd. hospital, it is a small, spanish style complex, in a quite community. <br/>
this is a second story apartment, with great interior. a private free satellite dish service which include expensive hbo channels. it has hardwood floors, granite kitchen counters and two a/c, plus a washer and dryer in the service area inside the apartment.  the apartment has bright exposure to the south, to the east and to the north.<br/>
beautiful hardwood floors, dining area in the kitchen, fridge and gas-range, ceramic flooring in the kitchen and bathroom.  this place is a great hollywood location to call home (we had even endured a three-day movie shoot here, twice, but it is enough). <br/>
you have copper plumbing, new electrical wiring system.  this is a cozy and well designed 1 bedroom.  the apartment was completely rebuilt in the setting of a 1917 spanish garden courtyard (tons of flowers in the spring).  there are 10 units here, and convenient street parking with preferential parking with city permit.  the neighbors here are exceptional people who keep true to the sense of community on this site. in fact, we have two m.ds. in the complex. the wrought iron entry gate locks as a safety feature. the address is 1342 1/4 north edgemont street. access to the bus or subway, food or groceries is within easy walking distance;  four streets west of vermont ave, half a block south of sunset blvd., by kaiser permanente hospital.<br/>
rent per month (1 year lease) is $1,740.00 (free satellite and wireless internet too) with a security deposit of $800.00.  indoor cats welcome, but sorry, no dogs (we have sensitive residents (we love'm too, but since there's no room to roam, you'd need to find a different home).<br/>
looking for quiet, respectful, &amp; low-key tenants.  good credit is required.<br/>

we have a one bedroom apartment for rent. it will be available on june 1st as the tenant hasn't moved out just yet and then we will have to repaint the unit. it is a cute apartment but bear in mind that it is on the small side so it is for preferably for one person only, there is a bedroom and a dining room, two small walk-in closets, bathroom with tub/shower/small sink and also a kitchen (there is a fridge but there is no oven in the unit, you would have to bring your own). there is a lot of light and a lot of windows, it is one floor only. there is a courtyard with secure entry. it has old hollywood charm with hardwood floors and french windows. there's no parking in the building but there's free parking on the street, that said it is usually easy to find parking within a block but it isn't ""always"" easy, rather be honest. no laundry room but there are 3 laundromats literally each no farther than a block away. we are in the middle of everything, walk to school, stores, coffee shops, close to griffith park, library and freeways and you can walk to the subway / bus stops as well. water is included in the rent but not the other utilities like power and gas. this is a one year lease which then becomes month to month. we do not accept pets, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
now please read this: the building is very quiet and peaceful and all the tenants are nice to each other, we are looking for the someone who is the same and appreciate this type of environment. we are looking for someone that doesn't blast his music or tv at all hours, who is considerate of his neighbors, that is clean and doesn't let trash pile up everywhere and is respectful to everyone (tenants here are all from different backgrounds). <br/>
<br/>
to qualify, please write a small synopsis on why we should rent the place to you. this place is nice for the price so we expect a lot of answers but we have had several terrible tenants in the recent past and of course we do not want that to happen again, so we will be screening and ask for references. there is a $15 credit check. <br/>
<br/>
thank you for reading and wishing you all the best of luck with finding your dream apartment! :)    </section>", (East Hollywood),"$1,250",1.0,400.0,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/apa/d/los-angeles-small-bedroom-for-quiet-and/7313176113.html,34.09,-118.2944,POINT (-118.2944 34.09),art,True

beautiful hardwood floors, dining area in the kitchen, fridge and gas-range, ceramic flooring in the kitchen and bathroom.  this place is a great hollywood location to call home (we had even endured a three-day movie shoot here, twice, but it is enough). <br/>
you have copper plumbing, new electrical wiring system.  this is a cozy and well designed 1 bedroom.  the apartment was completely rebuilt in the setting of a 1917 spanish garden courtyard (tons of flowers in the spring).  there are 10 units here, and convenient street parking with preferential parking with city permit.  the neighbors here are exceptional people who keep true to the sense of community on this site. in fact, we have two m.ds. in the complex. the wrought iron entry gate locks as a safety feature. the address is 1342 1/4 north edgemont street. access to the bus or subway, food or groceries is within easy walking distance;  four streets west of vermont ave, half a block south of sunset blvd., by kaiser permanente hospital.<br/>

this is a lovely master bedroom for rent. it is within a 2 bed/2 bath condo. this master bedroom is very spacious and has its own private bathroom and a huge walk-in closet. during the day it is very sunny and at night it is  very quiet. this condo has a dryer and washer within. it also comes with 2 tandem parking spots, one of which will be for you. the rent will cover water and garbage bill. electricity, gas and internet bill will be split. the room does not come furnished as shown in the pictures. the common area includes the living room and a kitchen. <br/>
<br/>
the location is convenient and is close to the metro red line. there are also many restaurants nearby. the condo is a 7-minute walk to the nearby children's hospital and kaiser hospital. if you work in any of the hospitals, you likely don't need to drive if you don't want to. <br/>
<br/>
this entire condo will be shared with me. i am a 30 some year old guy who works long hours in the hospital. i will mostly only be home on the weekends. i am a low-key person and very easy to get along with. i rarely have people over. <br/>
<br/>
the master bedroom is available now, but i will be willing to wait until july if needed. if you are interested, please feel free to email me and let me know.<br/>

</div>
the deets:<br/>
<br/>
$1,650/month all inclusive for a private room and bathroom in a spacious, centrally located 2-bed-2-bath in east hollywood. <br/>
<br/>
what does this include?! well, let me tell you!<br/>
gated parking space (they are tandem but there’s one spot per room)<br/>
laundry room on site with 2 washers and 2 dryers (coins optional!)<br/>
enclosed, gated small apartment complex with a central courtyard.<br/>
upper level apartment so no stompy neighbors over you.<br/>
high speed wifiiii (except for when it rains.. it’s la ok? i don’t understand it either)<br/>
use of a home theater with surround sound and access to many video subscriptions (showtime, hbo, netflix, prime, etc.)<br/>
full kitchen with a gas stove, washing machine, dual sinks, and a roomy ‘fridge.<br/>
use of fully stocked kitchen essentials including high end kitchen tools<br/>
a cute little balcony to sit out on when you drink your coffee (or tea... no kinkshaming).<br/>
vaulted ceilings, skylights, and a sexy little gas fireplace. oh baby.<br/>
central ac!<br/>
your own big room with a wall-to-wall mirrored closet and cool column decor. room will be unfurnished.<br/>
a bathroom you don’t have to share! woo!! and it has a shower/bath and actual counter space for your stuff. (low flow toilets though... sorry. it wasn’t our choice)<br/>
a responsive landlord and renting company that handles repairs quickly and efficiently.<br/>
private use of the apartment, minus one bedroom. i will be working a seasonal job in napa from august through november. you will have full use of the rest of the space. if you are in need of a two bedroom apartment, i can clear my room and leave it as a furnished bedroom. the total rent will then be $2,400 per month.<br/>
the 101 freeway is right around the corner so getting around is super easy.<br/>
the apartment is off of two central thoroughfares: melrose and santa monica boulevard. catching busses to all major locales is a breeze!<br/>
the vermont avenue metro station is a .8 mile walk away.<br/>
a jon’s market is right up the street! but there are also lots of cute local shops nearby.<br/>
you can peep at dtla from your bedroom window and wax poetic about the times we were able to go out.<br/>
<br/>
you, you must be:<br/>
gainfully employed and/or able to show you have at least 3 months rent saved up.<br/>
in your thirties. i’m too old to deal with 20 year olds, ok?! (i’m 33).<br/>
quiet and not the type to bring people over.<br/>
smart enough to cover your food in the microwave and not use metal on nonstick pans (this seems to be a big ask these days...).<br/>
okay with alcohol use but not inclined to use hard drugs.<br/>
able to do a detailed cleaning every other month. i’ll make it easy on you, there’s cleaning tools under the sink.<br/>
the kind of clean that only rarely leaves dishes in the sink and puts things back after you use them.<br/>
willing to remove your shoes before walking into the apartment (we have white floors... and also, ew, gross).<br/>
covid smart. until all this blows over, going to parties and travelling are really big no-no’s. masks are mandatory in all common areas of the complex.<br/>
<br/>
about me:<br/>
33 year old female with a career in hospitality (no, that doesn’t just mean i’m a bartender...)<br/>
uc berkeley grad, studied law in paris, and peacemaking in costa rica.<br/>
lover of the color black and hater of bright colors. i keep the decor minimalistic, and industrial like the recovering goth i am.<br/>
amateur wine maker.<br/>
i sleep in, drink coffee, study wine, and work out in my free time.<br/>
i love to cook and would cook for you, especially if you pick a good wine to go with it.<br/>
<br/>
if you’re interested in moving in, the cost will be first month ($1,650) plus $500 security deposit. this is such a great spot and i very much am looking for someone who will appreciate it and make it more amazing with me!<br/>
<br/>
i would need recent pay stubs or a screen shot of your account information to show financial stability. this is hard right now due to covid, i get it. my industry has been really hard hit, so please, talk to me. i’ll make things work for the right person.    </section>", (East Hollywood),"$1,650",2.0,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-big-gorgeous-apartment-to/7323940727.html,34.09,-118.2944,POINT (-118.2944 34.09),art,True
