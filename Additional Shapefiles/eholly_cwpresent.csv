why pay silverlake prices. gillman apartments has a rare opening in our 1930s spanish style pet friendly building in east hollywood. just a few blocks from the metro at santa monica and vermont, our location is close to anywhere you need to go in los angeles.  we are aware of all the changes covid has brought over the past year, so we have set up sitting areas in the back, with table umbrella and string lights. we have also opened up the roof area with tables and chairs to view the skyline and the stars at night.  the unit itself has been updated with tile flooring, tile counter on new white kitchen cabinets refrigerator and stove, and an updated bathroom. unit 203 faces the north cooler side in the warm summer months quickly approaching.  come walk the property and see what this up and coming area has to offer.  these units go quick with all utilities included.  downside is street parking only, but by permit, so not as bad as many areas. you can also ask rebecca for ideas on how to approach other buildings in the area to get a parking spot.    </section>", (East Hollywood),"$1,495",,475.0,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/apa/d/los-angeles-east-hollywood-spanish/7324473114.html,34.091419,-118.297529,POINT (-118.297529 34.091419),art,True

we (one female - 34 and one male-31 ) are looking for one roommate in their late 20's early 30's to fill two rooms that will be opening up july 1st.  rent is $1275 for the room, plus utilities. there is a $1490 security deposit due before move in date. it’s slightly higher , i know... but that is in part because the rent is very reasonable for the space etc. female or males welcome to apply.<br/>
<br/>
the house is an absolute dream. i moved in here two years ago and i simply adore it. super thankful for the place and looking for others who will enjoy what a great situation it is as well. not only is your room huge and in it's own corner with two closets, but there's so much footage in the common areas. this includes a dining room, living room, desk area near the living room, huge kitchen, dishwasher, washer and dryer in unit and parking. shared bathroom. roku tv in the living room with (non working) but pretty fireplace with backsplash.  lots of light in this beautiful space. <br/>
<br/>
the house was an airbnb before i moved in, so there are already some amazing furniture pieces in the house. some pictures i've posted are from the listing from two years year ago, the current living room set up is shown in the posting.  the bedroom comes furnished.  the picture with the pinkish vibes is no longer happening. it's just a king sized bed that you can make your own styling choices with. i am in the market for a few new living room seating arrangements, but in general the person moving in should not be bringing much for communal furniture as the vibe is minimalist / wabi sabi interiors, not big on clutter- this is v important. photos above are from the stock photos from when i originally rented the home but i added an irl photo of the living room. we keep it simple so its very similar. <br/>
<br/>
looking for someone who is clean and picks up after themselves. please only inquire if you know this to be true about yourself, and is not a question. yet!... also looking for someone who doesn't mind music being played and general pleasant vibes. we both are into music, all of it and listen to it often. people who enjoy mindfulness, positive communication behaviors, and home as the sanctuary please apply. we do not have pets but we love them and watch our neighbors dogs sometimes.  hobbies for me include : art/drawing, acting, photography, juicing/cooking, strangers. hobbies for him include : candle making, hikes/nature/camping, photography, bread.<br/>
<br/>
we are looking for longer term rentals (1 yr) and not subleases at this time. no couples, thank you. 420 :) <br/>
<br/>
neighborhood is east hollywood. i love this area in general. very close to west hollywood , silverlake , echo park , larchmont and on the edge of k town. could not be more central! the house is in between santa monica blvd. and melrose off western ave. down the street is a smart and final for quick grocery grabs, a taco bell, mcdonalds, dave's hot chicken, and chick-fi-la . gold diggers is a classic bar establishment that i love and go to occasionally for one or two, once it opens back up :)    </section>", (East Hollywood),"$1,275",1.0,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-gorgegous-east-hollywood/7326383080.html,34.090909,-118.309309,POINT (-118.309309 34.090909),security,True

** available july 1st, 2021 for short-term sublease from 1 to 3 months **<br/>
<br/>
i have a furnished private bedroom with en-suite bathroom in my 2 bed, 2 bath apartment for $1,850 per month which includes all utilities.  <br/>
<br/>
before you read the ad-- no smokers, no pets, and this room is for single occupancy, so no couples.  <br/>
<br/>
- the room is available from july 1st to september 30th, and you can sublease for a minimum of 1 month, up to 3 months. <br/>
- private bedroom with en-suite bathroom and closet. <br/>
- room is furnished with bed &amp; linens, desk and dresser.  towels also provided.  <br/>
- air conditioning &amp; ceiling fan. <br/>
- the best neighborhood in la with a 9.1 out of 10 walkability score.  <br/>
- walking distance to beverly center, 3rd st restaurants, trader joes, target and whole foods<br/>
- upscale furnishings in common areas.  <br/>
- parking is available in a tandem spot.  <br/>
- laundry within the building<br/>
<br/>
$1,800 per month.  utilities are included.  access to netflix, hulu and hbomax in the living room.  <br/>
<br/>
month-to-month sublease agreement.  <br/>
<br/>
i am a 33 year old white guy who lives in the other room.  i'm a television producer and tennis player.  i'm a really laid back, quiet, hyper-clean guy and looking for the same.  the common areas are furnished with expensive, upscale furniture and i am looking for someone who will be respectful of this and take care of it.  the vibe at the apartment is typically quiet and relaxing.  <br/>
<br/>
if you're just moving to la and looking for a safe place to land while you find your long-term living situation, this may be the spot for you.  the neighborhood is central in la, right in the center of the 4 bordering freeways (101 to the north, 110 to the east, 10 to the south, 405 to the west).  if you don't have a car, you'll find this a great neighborhood to start in because you can walk to trader joes, whole foods, target, the beverly center mall, and over 50 restaurants/coffee shops/juice bars/bakeries within 2 minutes of the apartment.  all you'll need is your own clothes to move in as everything else is taken care of.  <br/>

it's a couple of months out but i wanted to begin my search now. if you want to lock something down in la early this may be a great fit for you.<br/>
<br/>
1 bedroom 1 bathroom available august 1st. in 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apt. the room is actually available on jul. 27th, so if you want to move in early you can without having to pay extra. rent payments start in august. 1 parking spot in covered garage. gym and laundry in building. newly remodeled courtyard with comfortable seating and tables. this building is in east hollywood, in the heart of thai town directly below los feliz, griffith park and afi, just 2 blocks from the hollywood/western stop on the red line. it’s a 5 min drive to the 101, a 15 minute drive to silverlake or hollywood and a 20 minute drive to downtown la. everything is under 30 minutes away unless you’re going to santa monica or near the beach. this location is insanely convenient. the area is walkable and feels very safe. it’s far enough out of hollywood that it's quiet and feels like a neighborhood. there is cheap thai food everywhere and ralphs/ross/daiso/marshals/starbucks/ice cream/chase and more are all a 3 min walk way (+ $35/hour thai massages…) <br/>
i'm the roommate moving out of the apartment and have lived here for the last year. i love this apartment and am only leaving because i am moving to atlanta for work. the furniture you see in the common areas will be coming with me so you and eylam (my current roommate) will have a clean slate to create a living space that works for you both! bedroom has a large closet with storage space above, and the window in your room has blinds. the best part is that you have your own private bathroom  in the hall! total rent is $2,130, so you’re paying $1,065/month plus utilities. internet: $50/month, (you’re paying $25) plus gas/electricity which is every other month and is between $50-$70, which we split (so even on the high end it's only $19 a month). there is a dishwasher, central ac and heat. about my roommate eylam: he’s a great guy who’s very clean and responsible. kind and understanding, and as an added plus is always on time with rent/utility payments. he is pet friendly but definitely not looking to live with a couple. if you're dating someone of course live your life but he's not looking for two new roommates, just one. last but perhaps most importantly, it's critical that you've been taking covid seriously. eylam will be conducting interviews online, but if you can show you’re vaccinated, we are more than happy to hold an in-person showing. we are both fully vaccinated here. we're hoping that whoever responds finds this comforting and not problematic. p.s. you’ll need to meet my landlord and get on the lease so if serious please be ready with the necessary paperwork. require security deposit of $780 for the apt and $105 for the electricity deposit. $880 deposit in total.--    </section>", (East Hollywood),"$1,065",2.0,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-bedroom-private-bath-avail/7323491511.html,34.104209,-118.305927,POINT (-118.305927 34.104209),private,True

though we're sad to see her go, our fourth roommate is moving in with her boyfriend and we're looking for a new person to join our 4 bedroom/2 bath home in weho. our apartment is the upper level of a duplex in an incredible location: just off the corner of melrose/la brea it's walking distance from the grove, fairfax flea market, tons of cool bars, stores, and more. we're all pretty close and sometimes go out/hang out together, so ideally we'd like someone who'd be down to do the same, but if you want to keep to yourself that's cool too. we like to keep shared spaces neat and clean but aren't ocd about it.<br/>
<br/>
rent is $1,000 a month + utilities and wifi. there's also a security deposit of 1,000. the room can come furnished if you are interested in keeping any of the furniture, just let us know. you'll share a bathroom with two other roommates, darius and buck, both of whom do a great job at keeping it clean and being mindful of the others who share it. there's a fully stocked kitchen and furnished apartment (though we're totally open to you bringing your own furniture). the place has a lot of spacious and is in a nice cool, safe neighborhood.  there is also central ac so even during the hot summers you will still be cool and comfortable! we also have a washer and dryer in the apartment, so you have the luxury of doing your laundry in the comfort of your home. there's permitted parking on our street so street parking is never an issue and we all spilt the cost of the permits. the lease is technically month-to-month, but we're ideally looking for someone who would stay for a while. the room officially opens july 1st, but if you want to move in earlier, we're open to that.<br/>
<br/>
meet the gang:<br/>
darius: 28, works for a marketing and advertising firm, likes to be active and enjoys working out and hiking. also enjoys hanging out with friends, listening to music, and is a huge j.cole fan since he is from the east coast.<br/>
<br/>
carrie: 25, originally from baltimore moved to la from new orleans 3 years ago. works far too many hours at a talent agency. when not working she enjoys spending too much money on food, alcohol, traveling and fancy candles. also, a big fan of getting stoned and water coloring, you should try it, it’s very therapeutic.<br/>
<br/>
buck: 28 from baltimore and has been living in la for 5 years. pre-covid he was very outgoing and hopes to get back to it soon. he works in the entertainment industry and loves chatting about all things film and tv. he enjoys meeting new people and excited to find someone to join the sycamore fam.<br/>

we have a one bedroom apartment for rent. it will be available on june 1st as the tenant hasn't moved out just yet and then we will have to repaint the unit. it is a cute apartment but bear in mind that it is on the small side so it is for preferably for one person only, there is a bedroom and a dining room, two small walk-in closets, bathroom with tub/shower/small sink and also a kitchen (there is a fridge but there is no oven in the unit, you would have to bring your own). there is a lot of light and a lot of windows, it is one floor only. there is a courtyard with secure entry. it has old hollywood charm with hardwood floors and french windows. there's no parking in the building but there's free parking on the street, that said it is usually easy to find parking within a block but it isn't ""always"" easy, rather be honest. no laundry room but there are 3 laundromats literally each no farther than a block away. we are in the middle of everything, walk to school, stores, coffee shops, close to griffith park, library and freeways and you can walk to the subway / bus stops as well. water is included in the rent but not the other utilities like power and gas. this is a one year lease which then becomes month to month. we do not accept pets, sorry.<br/>

now please read this: the building is very quiet and peaceful and all the tenants are nice to each other, we are looking for the someone who is the same and appreciate this type of environment. we are looking for someone that doesn't blast his music or tv at all hours, who is considerate of his neighbors, that is clean and doesn't let trash pile up everywhere and is respectful to everyone (tenants here are all from different backgrounds). <br/>
<br/>
to qualify, please write a small synopsis on why we should rent the place to you. this place is nice for the price so we expect a lot of answers but we have had several terrible tenants in the recent past and of course we do not want that to happen again, so we will be screening and ask for references. there is a $15 credit check. <br/>
<br/>

available june 2, 2021.  looking for a wonderful peaceful place?  here is an ideal apartment because of its modern and warm interior, reasonable priced, fine design, good location, and for the charm and character of the place. this one bedroom apartment with free satellite tv service, wireless internet (wi-fi) free, a washer and dryer in the unit, and of course free water, trash, gardening, and exterior lighting.<br/>
we are south of the prestigious kaiser permanente sunset blvd. hospital, it is a small, spanish style complex, in a quite community. <br/>
this is a second story apartment, with great interior. a private free satellite dish service which include expensive hbo channels. it has hardwood floors, granite kitchen counters and two a/c, plus a washer and dryer in the service area inside the apartment.  the apartment has bright exposure to the south, to the east and to the north.<br/>
beautiful hardwood floors, dining area in the kitchen, fridge and gas-range, ceramic flooring in the kitchen and bathroom.  this place is a great hollywood location to call home (we had even endured a three-day movie shoot here, twice, but it is enough). <br/>
you have copper plumbing, new electrical wiring system.  this is a cozy and well designed 1 bedroom.  the apartment was completely rebuilt in the setting of a 1917 spanish garden courtyard (tons of flowers in the spring).  there are 10 units here, and convenient street parking with preferential parking with city permit.  the neighbors here are exceptional people who keep true to the sense of community on this site. in fact, we have two m.ds. in the complex. the wrought iron entry gate locks as a safety feature. the address is 1342 1/4 north edgemont street. access to the bus or subway, food or groceries is within easy walking distance;  four streets west of vermont ave, half a block south of sunset blvd., by kaiser permanente hospital.<br/>
rent per month (1 year lease) is $1,740.00 (free satellite and wireless internet too) with a security deposit of $800.00.  an indoor cat is welcomed but sorry, no dogs. (love'm too but since there's no room to roam, you'd need to find a different home). <br/>
looking for quiet, respectful, &amp; low-key tenants.  good credit is required.<br/>

hello, hola, guten tag, bonjour. ciao. kon'nichiwa. hallo. nǐ hǎo. merhaba! :-)<br/>
<br/>
irishman looking for a room-mate for my 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment. located on swall drive, next to cedars sinai hospital, right in the heart of west hollywood, beverly hills, beverly grove triangle.<br/>
<br/>
room is available for move-in now (but must be approved by building first), ideally for at least 6 months (but open to renting until end of august).<br/>
<br/>
rent of $1395 includes fully furnished room (bed with mattress, sheets, pillows and comforter, towels, dresser, desk, office chair) and all utilities. (wi-fi, ac etc). also a dedicated parking space in underground parking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  why live in this neighborhood?<br/>
<br/>
  - great central location, surrounded by the neighborhoods of beverly hills, west hollywood (weho), beverly grove, with easy access to west la, westwood, century city. runyon canyon, santa monica and downtown la are about 20 minutes drive (on a good day).<br/>
 - walk score of 90! you can walk to shops (bristol farms and ralphs are blocks away, a couple of whole foods &amp; trader joes in a 20 minute walk radius), the beverly center and the grove, post office and banks. rodeo drive is just over a mile away.<br/>
- plenty of dining and entertainment within walking distance too; the ivy and four seasons are a couple of blocks away, with many world class dining options available in neighboring beverly hills and plenty of local cafes and bakeries. 15 mins walk to santa monica boulevard and the troubador. urth caffe on melrose about 20 minutes.<br/>
 - great farmers market in beverly hills every sunday.<br/>
- despite so much to see and do nearby, swall drive is a lovely, quiet, tree-lined residential street, so you will feel at home in no time.<br/>
 - if you like to run (like me), you can head to west hollywood park or beverly hills garden park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  i imagine that the location would work very well for someone working/studying at cedars-sinai medical center (only 3 blocks away) or ucla (about 15 minutes drive from here). or someone working in beverly hills, west hollywood, beverly grove, westwood, west los angeles, century city.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  why live in this apartment?<br/>
<br/>
 - the apartment has been remodeled and all rooms have been freshly painted.<br/>
 - room is furnished with a bed, desk, chair and dresser etc.<br/>
- you will have your own bathroom (across from the bedroom).<br/>
 - wi-fi throughout. <br/>
  - it's a great building. quiet, mature neighbors, with an on-site manager, on-site laundry, secure entry with cameras<br/>
 - the apartment is on the third floor, the top floor. that means there is no-one above, plus you can sit out on the balcony and enjoy the afternoon sun.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
fyi, the apartment does not have a pool or gym and i have no tv in the apartment (i watch everything on my laptop).<br/>
  about me:   i am a 48 year old male. i am from ireland (come from a small-town, conservative environment) and came to the us in 1994. i have also lived in england, belgium, the netherlands and colombia (se habla espanol).   i recently relocated to la from the east coast and i operate a marketing business from home. unlike the typical irish person, i don't drink alcohol... my main vice being chocolate!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  the number one thing i am looking for in a room-mate is someone who is quiet.<br/>
<br/>
 i am a quiet, private person and regard the apartment as my sanctuary and i do my socializing outside. if you spend a lot of time on the phone, like to have a tv or music blaring or have a hectic social life, then this may not be a good match.<br/>
<br/>
my previous tenants have both said that they loved the fact that when they came home from work, they had privacy , peace and quiet and could go to bed early without fear of noise, loud phone calls or distraction.<br/>
also, out of respect for my tenant, i don’t have over-night guests (except perhaps the odd family member visiting from out of town, once in a blue moon) and would ask the same from a new tenant. i understand that doesn't work for some people, but it will be perfect for the type of tenant that works best for this location. so, if you are looking for a place for your partner to come over and spend the night, then this would not be a suitable place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
apart from that, i am easy-going about most things and want you to feel completely relaxed and at home here. i imagine that this apt. would mainly appeal to a mature, settled, conservative, cosmopolitan individual who enjoys the art of conversation, reading and travel. also perfect for a grad student or someone studying for lsats.    <br/>
<br/>
building policy is no smoking of any substance within the property and (unfortunately) no pets. <br/>
<br/>
please feel free to email with any questions and, if interested, please tell me:<br/>
<br/>
1) a little about yourself. (social media handles, if applicable). preference given to someone working outside the apartment, as i work from home.<br/>
2) what you are looking for in a living situation.<br/>
3) how long a lease you are looking for.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
note: building requires all residents to pass a background check, so good credit and evidence of employment etc. are needed.<br/>
<br/>
move-in requires first month’s rent and one month’s rent as deposit, to be returned on moving out.<br/>
many thanks for reading this far and good luck in your search...☺<br/>
<br/>

</div>
this is a lovely master bedroom for rent. it is within a 2 bed/2 bath condo. this master bedroom is very spacious and has its own private bathroom and a huge walk-in closet. during the day it is very sunny and at night it is  very quiet. this condo has a dryer and washer within. it also comes with 2 tandem parking spots, one of which will be for you. the rent will cover water and garbage bill. electricity, gas and internet bill will be split. the room does not come furnished as shown in the pictures. the common area includes the living room and a kitchen. <br/>
<br/>
the location is convenient and is close to the metro red line. there are also many restaurants nearby. the condo is a 7-minute walk to the nearby children's hospital and kaiser hospital. if you work in any of the hospitals, you likely don't need to drive if you don't want to. <br/>
<br/>
this entire condo will be shared with me. i am a 30 some year old guy who works long hours in the hospital. i will mostly only be home on the weekends. i am a low-key person and very easy to get along with. i rarely have people over. <br/>
<br/>
the master bedroom is available now, but i will be willing to wait until july if needed. if you are interested, please feel free to email me and let me know.<br/>

</div>
the deets:<br/>
<br/>
$1,650/month all inclusive for a private room and bathroom in a spacious, centrally located 2-bed-2-bath in east hollywood. <br/>
<br/>
what does this include?! well, let me tell you!<br/>
gated parking space (they are tandem but there’s one spot per room)<br/>
laundry room on site with 2 washers and 2 dryers (coins optional!)<br/>
enclosed, gated small apartment complex with a central courtyard.<br/>
upper level apartment so no stompy neighbors over you.<br/>
high speed wifiiii (except for when it rains.. it’s la ok? i don’t understand it either)<br/>
use of a home theater with surround sound and access to many video subscriptions (showtime, hbo, netflix, prime, etc.)<br/>
full kitchen with a gas stove, washing machine, dual sinks, and a roomy ‘fridge.<br/>
use of fully stocked kitchen essentials including high end kitchen tools<br/>
a cute little balcony to sit out on when you drink your coffee (or tea... no kinkshaming).<br/>
vaulted ceilings, skylights, and a sexy little gas fireplace. oh baby.<br/>
central ac!<br/>
your own big room with a wall-to-wall mirrored closet and cool column decor. room will be unfurnished.<br/>
a bathroom you don’t have to share! woo!! and it has a shower/bath and actual counter space for your stuff. (low flow toilets though... sorry. it wasn’t our choice)<br/>
a responsive landlord and renting company that handles repairs quickly and efficiently.<br/>
private use of the apartment, minus one bedroom. i will be working a seasonal job in napa from august through november. you will have full use of the rest of the space. if you are in need of a two bedroom apartment, i can clear my room and leave it as a furnished bedroom. the total rent will then be $2,400 per month.<br/>
the 101 freeway is right around the corner so getting around is super easy.<br/>
the apartment is off of two central thoroughfares: melrose and santa monica boulevard. catching busses to all major locales is a breeze!<br/>
the vermont avenue metro station is a .8 mile walk away.<br/>
a jon’s market is right up the street! but there are also lots of cute local shops nearby.<br/>
you can peep at dtla from your bedroom window and wax poetic about the times we were able to go out.<br/>
<br/>
you, you must be:<br/>
gainfully employed and/or able to show you have at least 3 months rent saved up.<br/>
in your thirties. i’m too old to deal with 20 year olds, ok?! (i’m 33).<br/>
quiet and not the type to bring people over.<br/>
smart enough to cover your food in the microwave and not use metal on nonstick pans (this seems to be a big ask these days...).<br/>
okay with alcohol use but not inclined to use hard drugs.<br/>
able to do a detailed cleaning every other month. i’ll make it easy on you, there’s cleaning tools under the sink.<br/>
the kind of clean that only rarely leaves dishes in the sink and puts things back after you use them.<br/>
willing to remove your shoes before walking into the apartment (we have white floors... and also, ew, gross).<br/>
covid smart. until all this blows over, going to parties and travelling are really big no-no’s. masks are mandatory in all common areas of the complex.<br/>
<br/>
about me:<br/>
33 year old female with a career in hospitality (no, that doesn’t just mean i’m a bartender...)<br/>
uc berkeley grad, studied law in paris, and peacemaking in costa rica.<br/>
lover of the color black and hater of bright colors. i keep the decor minimalistic, and industrial like the recovering goth i am.<br/>
amateur wine maker.<br/>
i sleep in, drink coffee, study wine, and work out in my free time.<br/>
i love to cook and would cook for you, especially if you pick a good wine to go with it.<br/>
<br/>
if you’re interested in moving in, the cost will be first month ($1,650) plus $500 security deposit. this is such a great spot and i very much am looking for someone who will appreciate it and make it more amazing with me!<br/>
<br/>
i would need recent pay stubs or a screen shot of your account information to show financial stability. this is hard right now due to covid, i get it. my industry has been really hard hit, so please, talk to me. i’ll make things work for the right person.    </section>", (East Hollywood),"$1,650",2.0,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-big-gorgeous-apartment-to/7323940727.html,34.09,-118.2944,POINT (-118.2944 34.09),art,True

broadway! the most up and coming street in dtla! area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. you want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  this building is also across the street from the roxie, cameo, &amp; arcade theaters! these are just three of the many historic theaters on broadway!  broadway was the original hollywood and stars like charlie chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. the spring arcade food hall is also located across the street. incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the bringing back broadway organization. only signage allowed on broadway is now neon! <br/>
<br/>
ground floor: has soaring ceilings!  there's central hvac along with windowed frontage and a metal roll-up door for security. space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. space can be used for any kind of permitted retail space or office space. space is ideal for an art gallery! other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! space has private bathroom! there's also 3 offices in the back! smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
basement: basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. it has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. doesn't have hvac at the moment.<br/>
<br/>

incredible 12-story creative office building located on gallery row, in downtown la's old bank district, technically in the historic core. this building was originally home to the crocker bank and is positioned on spring street, the most popular street for creative types in dtla, numbers-wise. this area is brimming with creative activity. nearly countless bars, restaurants, and cafes dot the map nearby along with the post office across the street. the dtla art walk (2nd thursday of every month) occurs here on spring street, largely between 4th-8th streets. the world famous night club the exchange is a block away. this building is home to artists, fashion designers, attorneys, accountants, media, marketing/pr, and many more. there's also a hair salon and yoga studio in the building. excellent amenities including a cafe on the 9th floor (spring st cafe), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the crocker club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. the building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. there's also on-site management and maintenance. there's shared mens, womens, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access. <br/>
<br/>
this is the coolest &amp; most unique space in the building! and the biggest, for that matter.  space has polished cement floors along with gorgeous windows.  the space is a corner unit and the conference room (yes there is one) is in the corner.  incredible picture frame wall and column molding give this space a historic, elegant look, and the raw brick and glass office walls lend itself to a high tech feeling environment.  there's amazing skylights that were discovered during renovation.  there's 7 private offices!  reception area as well. photos speak for themselves!  great natural light!  there is a hidden speak-easy bar/lunchroom in the space as well, and it's complete with a kitchen, full bar, and refrigerator!  the bookshelf is a secret door!  last but not least, there's a huge media room as well along with an additional private room in there.  <br/>
<br/>

broadway! the most up and coming street in dtla! area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. you want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  this building is also across the street from the roxie, cameo, &amp; arcade theaters! these are just three of the many historic theaters on broadway!  broadway was the original hollywood and stars like charlie chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. the spring arcade food hall is also located across the street. incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the bringing back broadway organization. only signage allowed on broadway is now neon! <br/>
<br/>
ground floor: has soaring ceilings!  there's central hvac along with windowed frontage and a metal roll-up door for security. space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. space can be used for any kind of permitted retail space or office space. space is ideal for an art gallery! other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! space has private bathroom! there's also 3 offices in the back! smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
basement: basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. it has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. doesn't have hvac at the moment.<br/>

broadway! the most up and coming street in dtla! area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. you want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  this building is also across the street from the roxie, cameo, &amp; arcade theaters! these are just three of the many historic theaters on broadway!  broadway was the original hollywood and stars like charlie chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. the spring arcade food hall is also located across the street. incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the bringing back broadway organization. only signage allowed on broadway is now neon! <br/>
<br/>
ground floor: has soaring ceilings!  there's central hvac along with windowed frontage and a metal roll-up door for security. space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. space can be used for any kind of permitted retail space or office space. space is ideal for an art gallery! other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! space has private bathroom! there's also 3 offices in the back! smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
basement: basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. it has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. doesn't have hvac at the moment.<br/>

small ground floor single-room retail space with windowed frontage and signage opportunity. exposed ceilings and large black polished tile flooring inside. the flooring is a bit slanted. this building is part of a large lot with a parking lot, parking upstairs, and another 13-story building on the spring street side (parking not included). located on main street between 7th/8th st, this building gets a good amount of drive-by traffic and some walk-by traffic. it's right next to a brand new apartment development, and across the street soon-to-be-finished-renovating dearden's building.  it's really hard to ground floor retail space like this at this monthly rate! in fact, it's even hard to find ground floor retail space for $2000! it would be good for an office for no more than two people or a super small store of some kind.  there's already a mini-mart in the building, so no mini-marts allowed.  space shares a common area restroom inside the parking garage. a/c options available.  24/7 access.  get it before someone swoops it up!  on all our listings minimal one year leases are accepted only! ask advantages of signing a 5 year lease! showings by appointment only! we are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn’t meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does! please go to dtlarealestate.com and submit your info in the quick contact form or call/text 213-304-4727 now! thank you! and don’t forget to follow us on social media at the links below!<br/>

the biggest thing to come to broadway in decades.  brand new construction, this building isn't even finished being built yet!  upstairs are condos for sale.  this listing is for the ground floor retail facing broadway only, and not the only corner space or space facing 4th st, those are leased.  amazingly beautiful space with soaring approximately 18 foot ceilings!  space currently has cement flooring that can, of course, be polished, or have another flooring added.  central hvac is already installed.  existing plumbing for a private bathroom is in place.  space is build to suit, per negotiation, landlord can improve the space to meet ones needs.  floor to ceiling windows flood this space with natural light.  this space is a block away from the famous grand central market.  the building across the street is likely to be demolished to make way for another brand new development.  around the block on 4th and spring street two brand new hotels are openning up, making this one of the most exciting blocks in downtown la.  there's infinite possibilities here. this prime retail space could be yours or your clients.  it's here now, but not for long. showings by appointment only. we are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn't meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does. please go to our web-site dtlarealestate.com and submit your information on the quick contact form or call/text 213-304-4727 now! and don’t forget to follow us on social media at the links below!<br/>

the biggest thing to come to broadway in decades.  brand new construction, this building isn't even finished being built yet!  upstairs are condos for sale.  this listing is for the ground floor retail facing broadway only, and not the only corner space or space facing 4th st, those are leased.  amazingly beautiful space with soaring approximately 18 foot ceilings!  space currently has cement flooring that can, of course, be polished, or have another flooring added.  central hvac is already installed.  existing plumbing for a private bathroom is in place.  space is build to suit, per negotiation, landlord can improve the space to meet ones needs.  floor to ceiling windows flood this space with natural light.  this space is a block away from the famous grand central market.  the building across the street is likely to be demolished to make way for another brand new development.  around the block on 4th and spring street two brand new hotels are openning up, making this one of the most exciting blocks in downtown la.  there's infinite possibilities here. this prime retail space could be yours or your clients.  it's here now, but not for long. showings by appointment only. we are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn't meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does. please go to our web-site dtlarealestate.com and submit your information on the quick contact form or call/text 213-304-4727 now! and don’t forget to follow us on social media at the links below!<br/>

newly renovated restaurant space for lease in south pasadena! the famous rialto theater has had a phenomenal facelift and the retail has undergone an amazing renovation! this stunning space has been freshly cleaned up and painted. the ceilings are an estimated 18′ high ceilings with large windows stretching to the ceiling! massive amounts of natural light flood this space, and what a beautiful space it is. it features an existing functioning vent/hood along with multiple sinks. there’s a countertop that opens from the kitchen/cooking area right into the space. infinite possibilities for restaurant/café spaces for this space. located in an excellent location with tons of drive-by traffic! as far as permits go, due diligence has yet to have been done regarding whether they are active or not. yet, for qualified lessee’s lessor may consider a free rent period if any permit work is needed. space features an ada size bathroom (lessee to verify) along with a small bathroom in the kitchen. there’s a second floor storage area as well that’s approximately 120sf, and is included in the quoted rent rate. i imagine a restaurant/café concept that does a lot of take-out and delivery would find this opportunity the most attractive since there is limited space for seating. get it before someone else comes and takes this hot opportunity off the market! showings by appointment only! we are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn’t meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does! please call/text 213-304-4727 now! thank you! and don’t forget to follow us on social media at the links below!<br/>
