seeking a potential long term new roomate to share my home with. current roomate will be leaving . i keep to myself alot and would be nice to find someone who is similar. ideally i would like to have a hard working clean and respectful roomate willing to share household duties etc.. i am a pretty chill easy going guy, i smoke weed and enjoy a good drink and all outdoor things.. have a big garden and lots of house plants. there is some storage space but not alot so its best if you dont have too many loose odds and ends. the basement space is unfurnished and is a pretty sweet space for you to set up and decorate as you like. i am in the middle of repainting the whole house as well so hope you like the colors.contact here <a class=""show-contact"" data-href=""/reply/lax/roo/7324282433/__service_id__"" href=""#"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""click to show contact info"">show contact info</a>

pets are a pssibility so long as you are a responsible owner. i have compost and garden beds in the back so any dogs will have to be well behaved and not let out unattended.<br/>

that covers most of it. if your interested shoot me a message and we can see of we connect well and then proceed from there. i am having trouble loading pictures but will get som up soon.    </section>"," (BOYLE HEIGHTS, LOS ANGELES)",$0,,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/wst/roo/d/los-angeles-400-furnished-bedroom-in-xl/7324282433.html,34.030147,-118.208658,POINT (-118.208658 34.030147),,False

we have one private bedroom with a private bath available in a 3 bedroom house in boyle heights (this bedroom is furnished, although design has changed).  roommates names are josh and pedram. mid's 20. college educated and creative. one of us is from north carolina and the other roomie is a military veteran. <br/>
<br/>
the place isn't glam, but its a great place to live and have your own private bathroom. <br/>
<br/>
near all the major freeways: 5, 10, 60, 101, and 110. dtla and arts district is just a short 5–10 minute drive (it's not a bad walk or bike ride either). accessible to lots of bus routes that have stops on soto or chavez blvd. the gold line soto rail station is near.<br/>
<br/>
this room is currently on a month-to-month term. rent is $850 due on the first of each month plus share the utilities (water, sewer, electric, trash) that's about an additional $70.<br/>
<br/>
please contact me (jess) if you are interested so we can arrange to show you the place and/or answer any questions you may have first. it would also be helpful if you tell us a little about yourself!    </section>", (Boyle Heights),$850,,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-private-bathroom-furnished/7322043633.html,34.0245,-118.1975,POINT (-118.1975 34.0245),private,True

this old world styled italian built duplex sits at the rear of a large lot. there is a shared front yard perfect for gardening. there is a shared driveway for 3 cars. <br/>
there is a nice hilltop breeze. unit is very private and comes clean with fresh paint.<br/>
it has a historic kitchen and bathroom.<br/>
tenants to the right side are very quiet and peaceful. we would like to retain this calmness in the spirit of peace.  <br/>
<br/>
this is a very safe community with many different ethnicities and age groups.<br/>
this unit is literally less than 1 mile from downtown, best described by its landmarks, chinatown to the left, echo park to the right, dodger stadium behind and downtown in front.<br/>
there are a number of wild peacocks that live on the hill.<br/>
we prefer a non-smoker willing to sign a one year lease.<br/>

not all apartment communities are created equal. to stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. first, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. so what makes valley street apartments special?<br/>
when you come home to valley st. apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. you'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/>
<br/>
you'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of echo park and silver lake. our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic los angeles landmarks, and so much more. and with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/>
<br/>
maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. if so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

not all apartment communities are created equal. to stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. first, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. so what makes valley street apartments special?<br/>
when you come home to valley st. apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. you'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/>
<br/>
you'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of echo park and silver lake. our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic los angeles landmarks, and so much more. and with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/>
<br/>
maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. if so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

<br/>
the kitchen has an electric stove, a refrigerator with a freezer, a sink, a dishwasher and four high chairs (that come with the room). the living room right next to the kitchen has a large couch (also comes with the apartment) and a central table. there is also a balcony with a view that faces the pool. all of these would be shared with the other people living in the unit (usually up to 3 people).<br/>
<br/>
currently one female is living in one of the rooms in this unit. i would prefer a younger female for this unit.<br/>
<br/>
this would be a sublet for two months (june and july). if you like living there and are staying in la you can get rent for a year and it would be at the same price. currently there is no security deposit, previously it was $500.<br/>

broadway! the most up and coming street in dtla! area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. you want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  this building is also across the street from the roxie, cameo, &amp; arcade theaters! these are just three of the many historic theaters on broadway!  broadway was the original hollywood and stars like charlie chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. the spring arcade food hall is also located across the street. incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the bringing back broadway organization. only signage allowed on broadway is now neon! <br/>
<br/>
ground floor: has soaring ceilings!  there's central hvac along with windowed frontage and a metal roll-up door for security. space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. space can be used for any kind of permitted retail space or office space. space is ideal for an art gallery! other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! space has private bathroom! there's also 3 offices in the back! smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
basement: basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. it has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. doesn't have hvac at the moment.<br/>

small ground floor single-room retail space with windowed frontage and signage opportunity. exposed ceilings and large black polished tile flooring inside. the flooring is a bit slanted. this building is part of a large lot with a parking lot, parking upstairs, and another 13-story building on the spring street side (parking not included). located on main street between 7th/8th st, this building gets a good amount of drive-by traffic and some walk-by traffic. it's right next to a brand new apartment development, and across the street soon-to-be-finished-renovating dearden's building.  it's really hard to ground floor retail space like this at this monthly rate! in fact, it's even hard to find ground floor retail space for $2000! it would be good for an office for no more than two people or a super small store of some kind.  there's already a mini-mart in the building, so no mini-marts allowed.  space shares a common area restroom inside the parking garage. a/c options available.  24/7 access.  get it before someone swoops it up!  on all our listings minimal one year leases are accepted only! ask advantages of signing a 5 year lease! showings by appointment only! we are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn’t meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does! please go to dtlarealestate.com and submit your info in the quick contact form or call/text 213-304-4727 now! thank you! and don’t forget to follow us on social media at the links below!<br/>

first off, we are not desperate to fill this room; we are just looking for the right fit for our home.<br/>
<br/>
we have a big house (2,300sq ft) located less than 1 mile from usc-hsc campus and la county hospital. close to downtown and the arts district. also 4 blocks from the metro gold line. we are renting out 1 of the large (150sq ft) bedrooms for $900, plus utilities (about $70/month). close to public transit and i-10, i-5, and 101. down the street is the main stretch of businesses on cesar chavez such as: guisados's, george's burgers, brooklyn pizza, king taco, walgreens, a cool local book store and record store, and a delicious (and cheap) juice bar!<br/>
<br/>
our kitchen is large and spacious. large front patio and back yard oasis with a pergola, firepit, and landscaping. plenty of storage on site that you are free to use. washer/dryer in the basement.<br/>
<br/>
ideal for a very clean and professional adult. <br/>
no pets please. no subleasing. not a party house.<br/>
we do have our occasional get togethers and such in the back yard, but it is definitely not a regular thing. we are all rather quiet and respectful of others' time and space in the home. <br/>
<br/>
month to month<br/>
<br/>
you will need first month rent and deposit of $500 ($1,400 total to move in) and proof of income. if interested, send me an email! <br/>
<br/>
serious inquiries only.<br/>

ultimately, home is all about the details. for an apartment home to be unique, it needs more than just a reasonable amount of living space; it needs amenities that enrich your life, in a place that enhances your experiences. at grandview towers, those details are our priority.<br/>
<br/>
as you explore your new apartment home, you'll notice a wide variety of thoughtful amenities. look up and you'll see soaring vaulted ceilings, which create a feeling of space. look down and you'll see immaculate hardwood and tile flooring. run your hand along smooth granite countertops, and your eye can't help but wander to stainless steel appliances.<br/>
<br/>
just steps away lies our fitness center, providing plenty of opportunities to help sustain your busy lifestyle. look a little further at immaculately kept landscaping, where you can mingle and meet new friends and old. look further yet, and you'll see you're surrounded by the diverse and laid-back community of westlake. parks, restaurants, and museums are available, and you're less than two minutes from downtown los angeles.<br/>
<br/>
home is all about the details. if you're ready to take advantage of them, we're ready to have you. for more information about leasing, contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

<br/>
basement: basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. it has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. doesn't have hvac at the moment.<br/>

the biggest thing to come to broadway in decades.  brand new construction, this building isn't even finished being built yet!  upstairs are condos for sale.  this listing is for the ground floor retail facing broadway only, and not the only corner space or space facing 4th st, those are leased.  amazingly beautiful space with soaring approximately 18 foot ceilings!  space currently has cement flooring that can, of course, be polished, or have another flooring added.  central hvac is already installed.  existing plumbing for a private bathroom is in place.  space is build to suit, per negotiation, landlord can improve the space to meet ones needs.  floor to ceiling windows flood this space with natural light.  this space is a block away from the famous grand central market.  the building across the street is likely to be demolished to make way for another brand new development.  around the block on 4th and spring street two brand new hotels are openning up, making this one of the most exciting blocks in downtown la.  there's infinite possibilities here. this prime retail space could be yours or your clients.  it's here now, but not for long. showings by appointment only. we are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn't meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does. please go to our web-site dtlarealestate.com and submit your information on the quick contact form or call/text 213-304-4727 now! and don’t forget to follow us on social media at the links below!<br/>

newly renovated restaurant space for lease in south pasadena! the famous rialto theater has had a phenomenal facelift and the retail has undergone an amazing renovation! this stunning space has been freshly cleaned up and painted. the ceilings are an estimated 18′ high ceilings with large windows stretching to the ceiling! massive amounts of natural light flood this space, and what a beautiful space it is. it features an existing functioning vent/hood along with multiple sinks. there’s a countertop that opens from the kitchen/cooking area right into the space. infinite possibilities for restaurant/café spaces for this space. located in an excellent location with tons of drive-by traffic! as far as permits go, due diligence has yet to have been done regarding whether they are active or not. yet, for qualified lessee’s lessor may consider a free rent period if any permit work is needed. space features an ada size bathroom (lessee to verify) along with a small bathroom in the kitchen. there’s a second floor storage area as well that’s approximately 120sf, and is included in the quoted rent rate. i imagine a restaurant/café concept that does a lot of take-out and delivery would find this opportunity the most attractive since there is limited space for seating. get it before someone else comes and takes this hot opportunity off the market! showings by appointment only! we are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn’t meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does! please call/text 213-304-4727 now! thank you! and don’t forget to follow us on social media at the links below!<br/>
