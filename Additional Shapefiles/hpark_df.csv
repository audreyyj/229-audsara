One bedroom available for July and August. This lease is up in September but will have an option to renew. This is a 3 bedroom house. Two other women live here and work from home. This is a private room but shares a bathroom with one other roommate. The room also has a large closet. The house is newly remodeled and is a beautiful space to live in! This cute house is in an ideal location in Highland Park. Located off of York Blvd - in walking distance to the gold line, Occidental College, and many restaurants/bars/coffee shops. It has a gated side and front yard. The living room and kitchen are furnished but the bedroom will be empty. Street parking is available. Washer/dryer in unit. Calm, easy going, and very clean roommates - would be looking for the same! I have loved living in this house for 2 years but am relocating. Rent is $900 per month plus utilities. Please email me with a description of who you are and your living style.    </section>", (Highland Park),$900,,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/sub/d/los-angeles-july-august-room-sublet-in/7325152247.html,34.114500,-118.192900

Looking for 2 roommates for highland park house.<br/>
<br/>
4762 Charters Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90042-2223, United States<br/>

My roommates are moving out of the country and I would like to stay in this house as it’s pretty great. It’s on a hill and has a great view. Have one more roommate already. 2379 sq feet with garage. Everyone has their own bathroom. August 1 move in date. Prices for the rooms would be around 1350 but are subject to change as we haven’t ironed out all the details. I think the lease would be 1 year. This is a very preliminary posting.<br/>

About us: two young male professionals I work from home and the other roommate works throughout the week. We clean up after ourselves and are very respectable and not crazy. We sometimes have friends over for bbq’s if they’re vaccinated.

I'm renting a lovely, much beloved and very peaceful and clean 1100 sq. ft, 2 bedroom house with kitchen, living room, dining room, bathroom, large patio, a nice garden. I'm looking to rent it to a nice person (s) for 1-2 months.<br/>
Dates can be worked out between us. <br/>
<br/>
The home is a 1930's stand alone house nestled at the base of Monterey Hills. Features a private, gated 5000 sq ft garden with plenty of space to play, exercise, relax or have a meal al fresco. Private, gated parking on site. Hardwood floors, lots of light, W/D, central air and heat. Fully stocked kitchen with everything you might need including toaster oven, dishwasher, microwave, etc. The house has just been painted and is very clean. It has wifi, new washer/dryer--everything. Very private, quiet.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for the right person or folks to enjoy and respect my space and take good care of a home I love, possibly including some mellow succulent watering. Thank you!!<br/>
<br/>
Dates: Can be worked out between us, can be pro rated weekly. The main thing is that I am looking for someone who can commit to a minimum of 1 month and max of 2 months. Ideal dates would start around July 1.<br/>
<br/>
Rent is $2950/month not including utilities. I'll consider lowering rent a bit if the 2nd bedroom stays as an office as it is now. Please, no pets (I'm allergic). Smoking outside is okay. Please write an email and tell me a little about yourself and why you might need a place to stay in LA. Happy to do a virtual tour. Thank you.<br/>

The unit has 1100 sq.ft. of space in an open floor plan with a unique lofted lounging area in the living room (this is not one of the bedrooms). 2 bedrooms on opposite sides of the unit and a bathroom with dual sinks makes it perfect for roommates too.

Stair-only access from the street is not fit for physically disabled.<br/>
<br/>
The house is in Silver Lake, where the I-5 and SR-2 meet, a hipster mecca, offering easy access to all points in the city. Want to go to a Dodger's game, see the Hollywood star walk, visit Universal Studios or check out the nightlife in downtown LA? The property neighbors a lot of LA hotspots for shopping, dining, entertainment &amp; nightlife, including Atwater Village, Glendale, Sunset Junction, Echo Park, Eagle Rock, Highland Park, Hollywood, and downtown LA. There's a bus stop steps away from the front gate and 10 minute walk to groceries, restaurants, banks, library, bar, dog park, and plenty of outdoor recreation (Silver Lake resorvoir, LA River bike path, Griffith and Ellysian parks).<br/>
<br/>
$2500/month (up to 2 adults, $100/mo more for each additional adult occupant) + utilities (split equally among the number of people living in the house)<br/>

</div>
The unit is a side unit addition to the main house. The unit has its own private entry, parking space with gate (featured in photos) and only shares one wall with the main house. There is a shared laundry and dryer on site.<br/>
<br/>
Renters in the side unit would live as neighbors to us (we are also renters and live in the main house). We are a couple in our 30's with a 2 year old boy. We love the location, space, and having our family here. We are looking for a single person (or couple) who will be a respectful and friendly neighbor and easy to communicate with about our shared space. The property is smoke free (cigarettes). <br/>
<br/>
The side unit for rent has one large living room with a large closet, full bathroom, and kitchen, and one large bedroom with: 2 closets, a private full bathroom, and a side nook with a window which could be used for a office/desk.  It's very spacious for a single person but has been occupied by a couple as well.  The property as a whole has a front and back yard, with lovely trees and flowers.  The photo's featured have the current tenants belongings. The space is not furnished. <br/>
<br/>
Located in a prime area of Highland Park, this side unit is on a quiet residential street, but is extremely close to shops/coffee/yoga/bars/Highland Park Theater on Figueroa St. It is also a short walk (1/2 mile) to the Gold Line Metro and Dash bus. It is 10 minutes to downtown by car and less than 15 minutes by train. We use the train all the time.  Additionally, Ernest Debs Regional Park is right in our backyard and only a short walk to the trails up the hills of the park. <br/>
<br/>
Rent for the side unit is $1850 per month (+ 1 month deposit). This does not include utilities, which are split between the main house and side unit. The unit is available for move-in July 1st, but could be made available sooner if needed. <br/>
<br/>
Please email with a little bit of information about yourself, including what type of living situation you are looking for, what you do for work in Los Angeles, your age, and whether or not you are seeking the unit for yourself or as a couple. Let us know if you have any questions. We will email you back to set up a time to view the unit.<br/>

On the best street in the lower Hollywood Hills, surrounded by classic Spanish style homes, near  Wattles Estate and park. A midcentury one story home, upgraded , private. Our wonderful tenants of 11 years bought a home, and are moving out May 28. It will be ready for you to move in June 01, 2021.<br/>
<br/>
$3,950 for one adult add $250/month for a second adult. TWO IS THE LIMIT.  Young scholars are welcome,<br/>
no extra fee. Gardner Street skool is a few blocks away (that was Michael Jackson's school.)<br/>
<br/>
Country living in the middle of Hollywood, GREEN AND QUIET YET CLOSE TO ALL.<br/>
BEST LOCATION IN THE LOWER HOLLYWOOD HILLS. We know, because the two co-owners/landlords<br/>
have their homes a block away, been living here for decades. <br/>
Your future home is surrounded by a tall wooden fence. Private and quiet.<br/>
At the back there is  a 1+ 1 wing, but this is all one house.  You only share the laundry room. The other tenant is<br/>
a mature, single man, no noise, no parties.<br/>
Our street is in the lower Hollywood Hills, [above Hollywood Blvd., halfway between Fairfax and La Brea] on a quiet, cul de sac street of vintage Spanish style homes. Green views of the surrounding hills, hardly any traffic, yet walk just one long block to a bus stop, two more blocks get you to shops and restaurants on Sunset Blvd., a longer walk to Hollywood and Highland, restaurants, shopping, markets, Metro station, Kodak-Dolby, and El Capitan theaters, clubs (when they re-open soon) .. Hiking trails in the hill above you ....<br/>
Our dead end little canyon was subdivided in the 1920s, and has been a favorite of Hollywood folks since then.  The home directly across the street was Russ Columbo's (**).<br/>
Several other names lived around here, and in this house too. (Who? It is bad form to drop names, as I was told by George Clooney).<br/>
<br/>
LOOKING FOR ONE OR TWO RESPONSIBLE, QUIET PERSONS, WITH GOOD REFS.,<br/>
NON [INDOORS] SMOKING. PERFECT FOR WORK FROM HOME, (IT HAS A HUGE OFFICE/STUDIO).<br/>
<br/>
Front and side fenced yards.  As you enter, to one side the living room with hardwood floor, a wood burning fireplace. To the other side, the dining room. A corridor runs to the back of the house. On one side,<br/>
The KITCHEN is large, tile floor, upgraded cabinets.<br/>
Next is the master BATHROOM, all tiled, with a skylight, and the MAIN BEDROOM, hardwood floor, large<br/>
closet, and a door to the side yard and the laundry room.<br/>
On the other side of the corridor- bedroom #2, bedroom #3, bathroom #2, and at the end a 400 sq. foot<br/>
studio/office/ work room, all tiled floor, direct exits to the side yards.<br/>
Use it for anything that is not noisy ( no loud music, no loud power tools etc.)<br/>
<br/>
There is a beautiful and little known city park across the street.[the WATTLES MANSION ESTATE. Google it.].<br/>
Green hills views all around. Hiking/jogging roads and trails just above the house. Join your landlady and a neighbor on their morning walks).<br/>
<br/>
Plenty of street parking. [Not even a 'street cleaning day' restriction].<br/>
<br/>
A bus stop is two blocks away, on the corner of Curson Ave. and Hollywood Blvd.<br/>
<br/>
YOUR PET:<br/>

- 3 off-street parking spots<br/>
- Central AC/heating<br/>
- Large outdoor space (currently with picnic table, potted garden, and grill) <br/>
- Friendly, quiet neighbors<br/>
<br/>
ABOUT THE ROOM:<br/>
Rent: $900/mo + wifi/utilities ($60-90/mo depending on AC use)<br/>
- 12’ x 9’<br/>
- Larger of the two secondary bedrooms<br/>
- NW facing windows w/ abundant afternoon light<br/>

<br/>
ABOUT THE ROOMMATES:<br/>
#1: 29 year old medical student at USC. I work a lot and like the home to be a place a relax and recharge, and occasionally host a few friends. When not working I like getting outdoors to hike, ski, hit the beach, or golf. Always searching for the next great LA sandwich. Recently tried: the BLTA at Spoke Bicycle Cafe, highly recommended.<br/>
<br/>
#2: Early 30s attorney. I like to run, hike, and be active. I work both at home and in the office but am quiet. I'm always up for trying out a new brewery, restaurant, or attempting a new recipe. I have 2 friendly cats.<br/>
<br/>
ABOUT YOU:<br/>
- Organized with your bills (i.e. employed or student)<br/>
- Generally respectful of personal space and others' work schedules<br/>
- Not an aspiring DJ after 10pm at night<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested please send an email with a bit about yourself. If it seems like a good match we'll reach out to set up a showing. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Happy to send a video tour or additional pics of the home in its lived-in state, if desired.    </section>", (Montecito Heights),$900,3.0,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-room-available-in-3br-2ba/7325583167.html,34.093998,-118.207612

Hi there! Looking for a woman to fill a room in my 2 bedroom/2 bathroom apartment in HLP. The apartment is very close to Fig which has a of fun bars, coffee shops, and restaurants but far enough to still feel like a home-y neighbor. I’m 28 years old female and have two very friendly cats, so if you like cats this place is for you.<br/>
<br/>
I’m looking for someone down to earth and responsible. If you want to grab an occasional drink or hang, I’m there! But I’m also respectful of your space! Also living room needs to be furnished since my roommate just moved out. Happy to do that with you or I will absolutely take care of it. <br/>
<br/>
Please reply with a little about yourself and a social media handle so I know you’re real. Lease is month to month :)    </section>", (Highland Park),$900,2.0,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-female-wanted-private-room/7325258652.html,34.114500,-118.192900

</div>
Hello! I am moving into a new home soon (June/July) in the Highland Park/Eagle Rock area. I’m looking for a partner or two who might be interested in sharing a back house recording studio. For example, you may be someone who would want to have access to a studio a couple days a week, say Saturdays and Sundays, but you don’t want to rent a space full-time. Or you might be a producer/songwriter who works from their apartment who could benefit from a more professional space some of the time. <br/>
<br/>
If that sounds like you, reach out! If someone comes on board before I build out a space, it’s a great opportunity to offer your input to craft the space into something that works for both of us. My aesthetics are classic studio vibes, minimal-ish. Not like a dark cave - something creativity inducing.<br/>
<br/>
I am a freelance recording engineer/producer, and have lots of great gear/instruments that you will have access to (assuming they are treated with care). Neumann tube mic, AEA ribbon mic, dynamic mics, Altec preamp, BAE Neve preamp, Adam A77X speakers, NS10MM speakers, TEAC tape machine, digital Mellotron, Roland Jupiter synth, Hohner Pianet (like Rhodes/Wurlitzer), Roland JU-06, Critter &amp; Guitari synths, M-Audio Code49 midi controller, Apollo with tons of UAD plugins, Ultrawide computer monitor, vintage electric and acoustic guitars + basses, and more. TBD if I will be putting drums in the space.<br/>
<br/>
For two 4-hour blocks per week: $400/month.<br/>
For three 4-hour blocks per week: $580/month.<br/>
For two 8-hour blocks per week: $700/month.<br/>
For three 8-hour blocks per week: $900/month.<br/>
<br/>
I am slightly flexible on price, depending on your schedule and what (if any) gear of your own you’d like to add to the studio to share.<br/>
<br/>
Space is very limited. I am looking for one or two people max. Studio will be available to work in by mid July at the latest.<br/>
<br/>
The attached photo is of my former studio which was also shared, the location of the new studio will be in a standalone converted garage (with windows/power/air conditioning).<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, please reach out, tell me a bit about you, and I will send you some simple application questions to learn more about you and your studio needs. Thanks for looking!    </section>", (Los Angeles),$400,,300.0,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/wst/roo/d/los-angeles-backhouse-recording-studio/7318521995.html,34.123500,-118.218200

</div>
Hello, the room will be opening June 1st, and is located in a beautiful and picturesque highland park hill-house complete with views and private outdoor space/collective parking. <br/>
<br/>
The room itself is long and large enough to be both a bedroom and a music studio (that's what I did there for a year), and has it's own entrance, outside hang area, 1/2 bath. And of course comes along with access to the amazing house with Central heat/AC, private outdoor space (a small putting green), washer dryer, and views a plenty. The other two housemates are two male songwriters/artists in their 30's, live upstairs from the studio, and are respectful and cleanly. <br/>
<br/>
1700$ a month plus utilities, first and deposit due up front. Open to shorter stays but would prefer someone looking for a year lease to start.    </section>", (Highland Park),"$1,700",3.0,300.0,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-huge-bedroom-studio-with/7324949419.html,34.114500,-118.192900

</div>
ABOUT THE ROOM:<br/>
The room has a large closet and two windows. You will be sharing a bathroom with another roommate (she is very clean and respectful). Please note the room will not be furnished. There is a 6-month minimum lease, which will then roll over to month-to-month.<br/>
<br/>
ABOUT THE HOUSE:<br/>
The house is a 3BR/2BA craftsman in the heart of Highland Park. There is a washer/dryer in the unit and plenty of parking on the residential streets (Not at all like Hollywood where parking is a nightmare). The house is fully furnished but please note, the room itself is unfurnished. There is also a separate guest house in the back where there is also a tenant - so a total of three rooms in the house and one more in the separate back house.<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION<br/>
We are located 1 block from the popular York Blvd where there are plenty of shops, restaurants, and nightlife. There is a supermarket called Super A, a 5 min walk away. There is also a Trader Joe’s, Sprouts, Target and Vons about a 5 min drive away. We are also 5 mins from Figueroa St and Colorado Blvd where there are plenty of shops, restaurants, etc.<br/>
<br/>
CURRENT ROOMMATES:<br/>
We are women in our early-mid 30s. Our careers vary from bioresearch to film. We all work full time and both work remotely and onsite at this point (we are also fully vaccinated! woo!) A must for any new addition is that they are drama-free, reliable with bills and respectful of communal spaces as we have a very harmonious environment in the house.<br/>
<br/>
PETS:<br/>
There is a 12lb senior dog in the guest house and a 35lb dog in the house so you must be dog-friendly. They are both calm, well behaved, and trained. But unfortunately, we cannot have any additional pets.    </section>", (Highland Park),"$1,200",,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-bedroom-available-in/7322036386.html,34.114500,-118.192900

</div>
In brief: beautiful, spacious, centrally located, recently renovated, 1602 square foot house with 5 bed rooms / offices, 3 bathrooms, Nest-controlled central AC, dishwasher, washer/dryer, skylight, etc. available for rent June 1 or June 15.  (Could also rent it with only 4 bedrooms for $600 less, see below).<br/>
I can show it most days, with 24+ hour notice.  Please send me day(s)/time(s) that work for you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Full description: <br/>
Large, ~1602 sqft, 2-story home featuring a large kitchen with skylight / breakfast bar / 5-burner gas stove / stainless steel dishwasher, lots of natural light through double pane windows for energy efficiency and noise reduction, and Nest controlled central AC (air-conditioning) and heating throughout (there are actually 2 full HVAC systems, one for upstairs and one for downstairs each with its own Nest thermostat you can control from your smartphone if you want to!), and the second floor features beautiful European Oak hardwood flooring and views including hillsides (and a distant peek of the Hollywood sign through the back bedroom window!).<br/>
<br/>
This home has 5 rooms that could be used as bedrooms, work form home offices, etc.  2 are king-sized rooms, two queen-sized rooms, and a full-size room (there's plenty of room for more than just the bed in these rooms! And you could easily fit a king bed in the queen rooms, there just might not be room for nightstands on both sides of the bed if you do!). <br/>
1 king, 1 queen, and 1 full are upstairs as are 2 bathrooms (1 with bathtub, the other shower), + 1 king, 1 queen bedroom (with a large walk-in, Being John Malkovich closet) and 1 bathroom with shower on the ground floor. <br/>
<br/>
Great location near 3 parks (including soccer fields, tennis courts, basketball hoops), the LA river / bike path, public transit (nearby buses to downtown LA, Burbank, etc. + a Gold Line Metro stop just 0.8 mi away), and short drives / Uber / Lyft to DTLA, Echo Park, Silverlake, Dodger Stadium, Highland Park, Glassell Park, Mt. Washington, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Silver Lake Reservoir, etc. etc.  ~3 minute drive to the closest 2 super markets, or ~10 minutes to Trader Joe's, Sprouts, or Whole Foods.<br/>
<br/>
Looking for responsible, financially qualified tenants for a 1 year lease.  Security deposit equal to 1 month rent. <br/>
Credit / background checks required, to be paid for by prospective tenants (after you've seen and liked the place of course).<br/>
Owner pays water and sewer only. Tenants responsible for gas, electric, etc.<br/>
No smoking / no vaping. No parking provided. No pets preferred.<br/>
<br/>
I may need 24 hours or more notice before showing the unit to you, depending on the current tenants' schedules.<br/>
<br/>
This home shares a lot with another detached house with a red wood fence separating the two houses. A small front yard with guava tree, citrus tree, and rose bushes is shared. A brick patio / terrace shaded by the large guava tree will be made in the next few months.  There's also small patio spaces on the side of and behind the house.<br/>
<br/>
There's a clothes washer dryer in a laundry room outside of the back of the house for your exclusive use.<br/>
<br/>
If you are only interested in renting the house as a 4-bedroom (for $600 less), I've been thinking of converting the 5th bedroom off the back of the house into an accessory dwelling space, which would have its own entrance and would be walled off from the rest of the house.  If this were to happen, the washer and dryer would be moved inside near the kitchen for you. <br/>

Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for a roommate / good fit, to rent my extra private bedroom with a private bathroom on a monthly basis. The apartment has great energy, safe, quiet and clean. Located between York Blvd and Fig. on Ave 59 close to HLP Gold Line Station.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that the room would be unfurnished.<br/>
Room has brand new carpet and closet with big mirror slide doors.<br/>
<br/>
Features:<br/>
Lots of natural light<br/>
Washing machine, Dryer<br/>
Large living room<br/>
Large kitchen<br/>
Netflix, Hulu<br/>
Outdoor area with plants and chairs<br/>
<br/>
110 FWY - 10 minute drive to Downtown LA<br/>
<br/>
TRAIN - Gold Line Highland Park Station - (4 min by foot)<br/>
<br/>
WALKING distance to Supermarkets, Post Office, Bars and Restaurants<br/>
<br/>
My ideal roommate would be someone who also thinks that a living space should be a clean and quiet sanctuary and who has lived with roommates before and is comfortable sharing a space and keeping it clean. Pescetarian/Vegetarian/Vegan preferred. Also, no couples, no overnight guests or full house all the time. I am looking for a someone who loves a positive vibe with a friendly living experience. Please be open minded and a good communicator.<br/>
<br/>
This place is a relatively quiet most of the time to stay inspired for personal creative projects, personal grow, to rest/recharge, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I'm not looking for someone with too much furniture!<br/>
<br/>
A little about me, (mid30s) male from Berlin/Germany. I have tattoos, play guitar, 420 friendly but I don't smoke anything. No drinking. Musician and hobby photographer.<br/>
Nature and animal lover. Spiritual and quiet. I work during the week and on weekends on music, videos and photos. On my free time I like to explore the city, flea markets and art galleries, drink tea or coffee, listen to Ted talks or music and relax.<br/>
<br/>
This will be month to month but I am willing to do a 3 month lease first and if after 90 days we can sign a new lease for 6 months or a year.<br/>
<br/>
There's also a dog living with me. Hes a Shiba - he is very sweet and gentle and keeps to himself.<br/>
<br/>
If that's sounds all good to you, please send me a message with a little about yourself including your social media handle.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you and have a great day.<br/>

This area is brimming with creative activity. Nearly countless bars, restaurants, and cafes dot the map nearby along with the post office across the street.

This building is home to artists, fashion designers, attorneys, accountants, media, marketing/PR, and many more. There’s also a hair salon and yoga studio in the building. Excellent amenities including a café on the 9th floor (Café 9), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the Crocker Club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. All white walls, and natural light. The building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. There’s also on-site management and maintenance. There’s shared men’s, women’s, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access. The majority of the units have exposed ceilings, polished cement floors, large windows flooding the space with light, and track lighting. Per negotiation, Landlord can modify and improve the spaces to meet your needs. On all our listings MINIMAL ONE YEAR leases are accepted only! Owner may require a longer than one-year lease for this listing. If available, ask about the advantages of signing a 3 YEAR LEASE! Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY!

SPACE WILL HAVE NEW LIGHTING! (not shown in photos)<br/>
<br/>
Incredible 12-story creative office building located on Gallery Row, in Downtown LA's Old Bank District, technically in the Historic Core. This building was originally home to the Crocker Bank and is positioned on Spring Street, the most popular street for creative types in DTLA, numbers-wise. This area is brimming with creative activity. Nearly countless bars, restaurants, and cafes dot the map nearby along with the post office across the street. The DTLA Art Walk (2nd Thursday of every month) occurs here on Spring Street, largely between 4th-8th Streets. The world famous night club The Exchange is a block away. This building is home to artists, fashion designers, attorneys, accountants, media, marketing/PR, and many more. There's also a hair salon and yoga studio in the building. Excellent amenities including a cafe on the 9th floor (Cafe 9), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the Crocker Club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. The building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. There's also on-site management and maintenance. There's shared mens, womens, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access. The majority of the units have exposed ceilings, polished cement floors, large windows flooding the space with light, and track lighting. <br/>
<br/>
This space has ONE HUGE ROOM plus 1 PRIVATE OFFICE, the bosses office per se :)  This space is a CORNER UNIT facing 5th Street and has tons of  WINDOWS flooding the space with NATURAL LIGHT!

BROADWAY! The most up and coming street in DTLA! Area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. You want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! Location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  This building is also across the street from the ROXIE, CAMEO, &amp; ARCADE THEATERS! These are just three of the many historic theaters on Broadway!  Broadway was the original Hollywood and stars like Charlie Chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. The Spring Arcade FOOD HALL is also located across the street. Incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the Bringing Back Broadway organization. Only signage allowed on Broadway is now NEON! <br/>
<br/>
GROUND FLOOR: Has SOARING CEILINGS!  There's CENTRAL HVAC along with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and a metal roll-up door for security. Space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. Space can be used for any kind of permitted RETAIL SPACE or OFFICE SPACE. Space is IDEAL FOR AN ART GALLERY! Other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! Space has PRIVATE BATHROOM! There's also 3 OFFICES in the back! Smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
BASEMENT: Basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. It has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. Technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. Doesn't have HVAC at the moment.<br/>

The biggest thing to come to Broadway in DECADES.  Brand new construction, this building isn't even finished being built yet!  Upstairs are condos for sale.  This listing is for the ground floor retail facing Broadway only, and not the only corner space or space facing 4th St, those are leased.  Amazingly beautiful space with soaring approximately 18 FOOT CEILINGS!  Space currently has cement flooring that can, of course, be polished, or have another flooring added.  Central HVAC is already installed.  Existing plumbing for a private bathroom is in place.  Space is build to suit, per negotiation, landlord can improve the space to meet ones needs.  Floor to ceiling windows flood this space with natural light.  This space is a block away from the famous Grand Central Market.  The building across the street is likely to be demolished to make way for another brand new development.  Around the block on 4th and Spring Street two brand new hotels are openning up, making this one of the most exciting blocks in Downtown LA.  There's infinite possibilities here. This prime retail space could be yours or your clients.  It's here now, but not for long. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY. We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn't meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does.

BROADWAY! The most up and coming street in DTLA! Area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. You want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! Location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  This building is also across the street from the ROXIE, CAMEO, &amp; ARCADE THEATERS! These are just three of the many historic theaters on Broadway!  Broadway was the original Hollywood and stars like Charlie Chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. The Spring Arcade FOOD HALL is also located across the street. Incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the Bringing Back Broadway organization. Only signage allowed on Broadway is now NEON! <br/>
<br/>
GROUND FLOOR: Has SOARING CEILINGS!  There's CENTRAL HVAC along with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and a metal roll-up door for security. Space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading.

<br/>
BASEMENT: Basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. It has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. Technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. Doesn't have HVAC at the moment.<br/>

Small GROUND FLOOR single-room retail space with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and SIGNAGE OPPORTUNITY. Exposed ceilings and LARGE BLACK POLISHED TILE FLOORING inside. The flooring is a bit slanted. This building is part of a large lot with a parking lot, parking upstairs, and another 13-story building on the Spring Street Side (parking not included). Located on MAIN STREET between 7th/8th St, this building gets a good amount of drive-by traffic and some walk-by traffic. It's right next to a brand new apartment development, and across the street soon-to-be-finished-renovating Dearden's Building.  It's really hard to ground floor retail space like this at this monthly rate! In fact, it's even hard to find ground floor retail space for $2000! It would be good for an office for no more than two people or a super small store of some kind.  There's already a mini-mart in the building, so no mini-marts allowed.  Space shares a common area restroom inside the parking garage. A/C options available.  24/7 ACCESS.  Get it before someone swoops it up!

Master Bedroom For Rent In Huge 2 Story House with Walk-in Closet, Balcony, Garage, Washer, Dryer and Backyard. Granite countertop kitchen, hardwood flooring except in the bedrooms, dishwasher and washer and dryer in the house as well.<br/>
<br/>
This room will be opening up April 1. It's the master bedroom and private bathroom in a large 4 bedroom house, comes with a private bath and walk-in closet. Laundry in the house and a spot in the garage. Located in Montecito Heights, Highland Park/South Pasadena/DTLA adjacent.<br/>
<br/>
Your room is on the first of two floors, the other rooms are upstairs, and we don't go downstairs very often, so you basically will have the entire first floor to yourself most of the time. Roommates are mid 30s, super laid back, friendly and work in the music industry. We are progressive minded and whatever your age/race/sexual orientation/gender identity is, it would never be a an issue or even a consideration with us (as it should be). Dogs are cool as long as they are reasonably trained (housebroken, generally quiet).<br/>
<br/>
We can fit 3 cars total in the driveway including the garage, there is also plenty of unrestricted street parking (no racing out to move your car at 6am).<br/>
<br/>
The rent is $1225/mo with deposit. All that we ask is that you're responsible and clean.<br/>
<br/>

ABOUT ME:<br/>
29 year old medical student at USC. I'll be entering my final year of school this summer. Current roommates are both graduating but this apartment is too good to give up. I'll be working a lot and like the home to be a place a relax and recharge, and occasionally host a few friends. When not working I like getting outdoors to hike, ski, hit the beach, or golf. Always searching for the next great LA sandwich. Recently tried: the BLTA at Spoke Bicycle Cafe, highly recommended.    </section>", (central LA),$600,,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-3br-rooms-available-in-3br/7323027045.html,34.090000,-118.294400

Incredible 12-story creative office building located on Gallery Row, in Downtown LA’s Old Bank District, technically in the Historic Core. This building was originally home to the Crocker Bank and is positioned on Spring Street, the most popular street for creative types in DTLA, numbers-wise. This area is brimming with creative activity. Nearly countless bars, restaurants, and cafes dot the map nearby along with the post office across the street. The DTLA Art Walk (2nd Thursday of every month) occurs here on Spring Street, largely between 4th-8th Streets. The world famous night club The Exchange is a block away. This building is home to artists, fashion designers, attorneys, accountants, media, marketing/PR, and many more. There’s also a hair salon and yoga studio in the building. Excellent amenities including a café on the 9th floor (Café 9), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the Crocker Club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. All white walls, and natural light. The building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. There’s also on-site management and maintenance. There’s shared men’s, women’s, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access. The majority of the units have exposed ceilings, polished cement floors, large windows flooding the space with light, and track lighting. Per negotiation, Landlord can modify and improve the spaces to meet your needs. On all our listings MINIMAL ONE YEAR leases are accepted only! Owner may require a longer than one-year lease for this listing. If available, ask about the advantages of signing a 3 YEAR LEASE! Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY! We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn’t meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does!

BROADWAY! The most up and coming street in DTLA! Area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. You want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! Location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  This building is also across the street from the ROXIE, CAMEO, &amp; ARCADE THEATERS! These are just three of the many historic theaters on Broadway!  Broadway was the original Hollywood and stars like Charlie Chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. The Spring Arcade FOOD HALL is also located across the street. Incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the Bringing Back Broadway organization. Only signage allowed on Broadway is now NEON! <br/>
<br/>
GROUND FLOOR: Has SOARING CEILINGS!  There's CENTRAL HVAC along with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and a metal roll-up door for security. Space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. Space can be used for any kind of permitted RETAIL SPACE or OFFICE SPACE. Space is IDEAL FOR AN ART GALLERY! Other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! Space has PRIVATE BATHROOM! There's also 3 OFFICES in the back! Smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
BASEMENT: Basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. It has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. Technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. Doesn't have HVAC at the moment.<br/>
<br/>

The biggest thing to come to Broadway in DECADES.  Brand new construction, this building isn't even finished being built yet!  Upstairs are condos for sale.  This listing is for the ground floor retail facing Broadway only, and not the only corner space or space facing 4th St, those are leased.  Amazingly beautiful space with soaring approximately 18 FOOT CEILINGS!  Space currently has cement flooring that can, of course, be polished, or have another flooring added.  Central HVAC is already installed.  Existing plumbing for a private bathroom is in place.  Space is build to suit, per negotiation, landlord can improve the space to meet ones needs.  Floor to ceiling windows flood this space with natural light.  This space is a block away from the famous Grand Central Market.  The building across the street is likely to be demolished to make way for another brand new development.  Around the block on 4th and Spring Street two brand new hotels are openning up, making this one of the most exciting blocks in Downtown LA.  There's infinite possibilities here. This prime retail space could be yours or your clients.  It's here now, but not for long. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY. We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn't meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does.

BROADWAY! The most up and coming street in DTLA! Area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. You want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! Location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  This building is also across the street from the ROXIE, CAMEO, &amp; ARCADE THEATERS! These are just three of the many historic theaters on Broadway!  Broadway was the original Hollywood and stars like Charlie Chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. The Spring Arcade FOOD HALL is also located across the street. Incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the Bringing Back Broadway organization. Only signage allowed on Broadway is now NEON! <br/>
<br/>
GROUND FLOOR: Has SOARING CEILINGS!  There's CENTRAL HVAC along with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and a metal roll-up door for security. Space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. Space can be used for any kind of permitted RETAIL SPACE or OFFICE SPACE. Space is IDEAL FOR AN ART GALLERY! Other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! Space has PRIVATE BATHROOM! There's also 3 OFFICES in the back! Smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
BASEMENT: Basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. It has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. Technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. Doesn't have HVAC at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Get it before it’s gone! Ask us the advantages of signing a five-year lease! On all our listings MINIMAL ONE YEAR LEASES ARE ACCEPTED ONLY, and owner may require a longer than one-year lease for this listing. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY.

Small GROUND FLOOR single-room retail space with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and SIGNAGE OPPORTUNITY. Exposed ceilings and LARGE BLACK POLISHED TILE FLOORING inside. The flooring is a bit slanted. This building is part of a large lot with a parking lot, parking upstairs, and another 13-story building on the Spring Street Side (parking not included). Located on MAIN STREET between 7th/8th St, this building gets a good amount of drive-by traffic and some walk-by traffic. It's right next to a brand new apartment development, and across the street soon-to-be-finished-renovating Dearden's Building.  It's really hard to ground floor retail space like this at this monthly rate! In fact, it's even hard to find ground floor retail space for $2000! It would be good for an office for no more than two people or a super small store of some kind.  There's already a mini-mart in the building, so no mini-marts allowed.  Space shares a common area restroom inside the parking garage. A/C options available.  24/7 ACCESS.  Get it before someone swoops it up!

If there is a common area shared by the unit listed, the unit square feet listed on marketing materials are the gross (rentable) square feet which includes a 20% load factor (common area factor) added to the net (usable) square feet. For multiple reasons, the square feet are approximate and are not guaranteed, leases assume you measure the square feet of the space before leasing and approve of the calculation. Rent rate and terms on all of Quixotic Realty Inc's and affiliates advertisements and correspondences are subject to change so the final rent rate and terms are not valid or binding until a written lease has been signed by lessor and lessee. Please see our web-site for full disclosures.

Incredible 12-story creative office building located on Gallery Row, in Downtown LA’s Old Bank District, technically in the Historic Core. This building was originally home to the Crocker Bank and is positioned on Spring Street, the most popular street for creative types in DTLA, numbers-wise. This area is brimming with creative activity. Nearly countless bars, restaurants, and cafes dot the map nearby along with the post office across the street. The DTLA Art Walk (2nd Thursday of every month) occurs here on Spring Street, largely between 4th-8th Streets. The world famous night club The Exchange is a block away. This building is home to artists, fashion designers, attorneys, accountants, media, marketing/PR, and many more. There’s also a hair salon and yoga studio in the building. Excellent amenities including a café on the 9th floor (Café 9), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the Crocker Club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. All white walls, and natural light. The building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. There’s also on-site management and maintenance. There’s shared men’s, women’s, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access. The majority of the units have exposed ceilings, polished cement floors, large windows flooding the space with light, and track lighting. Per negotiation, Landlord can modify and improve the spaces to meet your needs. On all our listings MINIMAL ONE YEAR leases are accepted only! Owner may require a longer than one-year lease for this listing. If available, ask about the advantages of signing a 3 YEAR LEASE! Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY!

Incredible 12-story creative office building located on Gallery Row, in Downtown LA's Old Bank District, technically in the Historic Core. This building was originally home to the Crocker Bank and is positioned on Spring Street, the most popular street for creative types in DTLA, numbers-wise. This area is brimming with creative activity. Nearly countless bars, restaurants, and cafes dot the map nearby along with the post office across the street. The DTLA Art Walk (2nd Thursday of every month) occurs here on Spring Street, largely between 4th-8th Streets. The world famous night club The Exchange is a block away. This building is home to artists, fashion designers, attorneys, accountants, media, marketing/PR, and many more. There's also a hair salon and yoga studio in the building. Excellent amenities including a cafe on the 9th floor (Spring St Cafe), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the Crocker Club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. The building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. There's also on-site management and maintenance. There's shared mens, womens, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access. <br/>
<br/>
THIS IS THE COOLEST &amp; MOST UNIQUE SPACE IN THE BUILDING! And the biggest, for that matter.  Space has POLISHED CEMENT FLOORS along with GORGEOUS WINDOWS.  The space is a CORNER UNIT and the CONFERENCE ROOM (yes there is one) is in the corner.  Incredible picture frame wall and column molding give this space a historic, elegant look, and the raw brick and glass office walls lend itself to a HIGH TECH FEELING ENVIRONMENT.  There's AMAZING SKYLIGHTS that were discovered during renovation.  There's 7 PRIVATE OFFICES!  Reception area as well. Photos speak for themselves!  GREAT NATURAL LIGHT!  There is a HIDDEN SPEAK-EASY BAR/LUNCHROOM in the space as well, and it's complete with a kitchen, full bar, and refrigerator!  The bookshelf is a secret door!  Last but not least, there's a HUGE MEDIA ROOM as well along with an additional private room in there.  <br/>
<br/>
Per negotiation, Landlord can modify and improve the spaces to meet your needs. Ask me the advantages of signing a five-year lease! On all our listings MINIMAL ONE YEAR LEASE ARE ACCEPTED ONLY, and owner may require a longer than one-year lease for this listing. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY.

Location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  This building is also across the street from the ROXIE, CAMEO, &amp; ARCADE THEATERS! These are just three of the many historic theaters on Broadway!  Broadway was the original Hollywood and stars like Charlie Chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. The Spring Arcade FOOD HALL is also located across the street. Incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the Bringing Back Broadway organization. Only signage allowed on Broadway is now NEON! <br/>
<br/>
GROUND FLOOR: Has SOARING CEILINGS!  There's CENTRAL HVAC along with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and a metal roll-up door for security. Space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. Space can be used for any kind of permitted RETAIL SPACE or OFFICE SPACE. Space is IDEAL FOR AN ART GALLERY! Other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! Space has PRIVATE BATHROOM! There's also 3 OFFICES in the back! Smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
BASEMENT: Basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. It has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting.

The biggest thing to come to Broadway in DECADES.  Brand new construction, this building isn't even finished being built yet!  Upstairs are condos for sale.  This listing is for the ground floor retail facing Broadway only, and not the only corner space or space facing 4th St, those are leased.  Amazingly beautiful space with soaring approximately 18 FOOT CEILINGS!  Space currently has cement flooring that can, of course, be polished, or have another flooring added.  Central HVAC is already installed.  Existing plumbing for a private bathroom is in place.  Space is build to suit, per negotiation, landlord can improve the space to meet ones needs.  Floor to ceiling windows flood this space with natural light.  This space is a block away from the famous Grand Central Market.  The building across the street is likely to be demolished to make way for another brand new development.  Around the block on 4th and Spring Street two brand new hotels are openning up, making this one of the most exciting blocks in Downtown LA.  There's infinite possibilities here. This prime retail space could be yours or your clients.  It's here now, but not for long. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY. We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn't meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does.

Beautiful ground floor space available FOR LEASE! This property is located in DTLA’s Fashion District in the famous Santee Passage (aka as Santee Court).

This space is situated on Los Angeles St between 7th St and 8th St, and the Historic Core District, and all the amenities of the Historic Core, is only a few blocks away! So! Anyway this space is accessible from the side walk at the front end off Los Angeles St, shown in the photos. At this entrance there’s a food court and at the end of the passage a minim-mart. The other access point is from Santee Street. This space features windowed frontage, a front reception area, a conference room/office, a back open area with kitchenette, and a back private office. There’s also a storage closest. There’s built in desks that can be kept or removed, per negotiation. Excellent space with exposed ceilings, central HVAC, 24/7 access, great natural light, stylish glass walls, and more. This space shares a common area set of bathrooms on the second floor upstairs. Electricity not included. NNN/CAM INCLUDED!!! Rent rate applies for 1st year only, 2nd year is negotiable. This is a great price-per-square foot! Get it now before someone else swoops it up! Ask the advantages of signing a long lease! On all our listings MINIMAL ONE YEAR LEASE ARE ACCEPTED ONLY, and owner may require a longer than one-year lease for this listing. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY. We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn’t meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does!

Small GROUND FLOOR single-room retail space with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and SIGNAGE OPPORTUNITY. Exposed ceilings and LARGE BLACK POLISHED TILE FLOORING inside. The flooring is a bit slanted. This building is part of a large lot with a parking lot, parking upstairs, and another 13-story building on the Spring Street Side (parking not included). Located on MAIN STREET between 7th/8th St, this building gets a good amount of drive-by traffic and some walk-by traffic. It's right next to a brand new apartment development, and across the street soon-to-be-finished-renovating Dearden's Building.  It's really hard to ground floor retail space like this at this monthly rate! In fact, it's even hard to find ground floor retail space for $2000! It would be good for an office for no more than two people or a super small store of some kind.  There's already a mini-mart in the building, so no mini-marts allowed.  Space shares a common area restroom inside the parking garage. A/C options available.  24/7 ACCESS.  Get it before someone swoops it up!  On all our listings MINIMAL ONE YEAR leases are accepted only! Ask advantages of signing a 5 year lease! Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY!

Incredible 12-story creative office building located on Gallery Row, in Downtown LA’s Old Bank District, technically in the Historic Core. This building was originally home to the Crocker Bank and is positioned on Spring Street, the most popular street for creative types in DTLA, numbers-wise. This area is brimming with creative activity. Nearly countless bars, restaurants, and cafes dot the map nearby along with the post office across the street. The DTLA Art Walk (2nd Thursday of every month) occurs here on Spring Street, largely between 4th-8th Streets. The world famous night club The Exchange is a block away. This building is home to artists, fashion designers, attorneys, accountants, media, marketing/PR, and many more. There’s also a hair salon and yoga studio in the building. Excellent amenities including a café on the 9th floor (Café 9), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the Crocker Club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. All white walls, and natural light. The building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. There’s also on-site management and maintenance. There’s shared men’s, women’s, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access. The majority of the units have exposed ceilings, polished cement floors, large windows flooding the space with light, and track lighting.

This space is bank space/credit union space. DTLA RETAIL/OFFICE/MEDICAL SPACE for lease in the busy and well-known PROMENADE PLAZA! This property is located on the CORNER OF 1ST/HOPE ST right across the street from the DWP Building, Disney Hall, Music Center, and a block away from the mega Frank Gehry development that will soon be completed! This property is also a short walk to the soon to be completed new subway station! The property is a residential condo building upstairs known as the Promenade Towers and the retail below where the space is available is known again as the Promenade Plaza. Share the plaza with a great tenant mix including a Subway, a yoga studio, a cafe, an acupuncture &amp; herbal medicine office, a nail salon, a physical therapist and two restaurants! Unit 716 is a CORNER SPACE and has immediate visibility from the elevator from the parking garage.  As a corner space it gets natural light from two sides, and the unit has TONS OF WINDOWED FRONTAGE that could be used as advertising space.  It features it's on spot for signage and tons of outdoor seating available in the plaza.  This space was previously occupied by a CREDIT UNION so it's basically built out like a BANK SPACE.  The photos show the space as it is presently.  Another bank would be an excellent fit, but ANY PERMITTED USE IS POSSIBLE!  Per negotiation, landlord can deliver the space as an empty blank shell for a tenant wishing to use the space for a different use, such as medical office, dental office, and more. For well tenants who are well established and have excellent finances, landlord can, per negotiation, contribute to tenant improvements, aside from a basic demo.  It's also possible to subdivide the space into two units roughly 1100sf and 2000sf each.  The space currently has central HVAC, 2 private bathrooms, a server room, a lunch room, a teller station area, and a huge open area with divisions for desks.  Retail tenants have 24/7 access to the space and plaza. There’s a parking garage for the building as well where people can park for a daily fee of $10 of $200 monthly. It is also possible for retail tenants to validate their customers parking as well! Ask me the advantages of signing a five-year lease!

Incredible 12-story creative office building located on Gallery Row, in Downtown LA's Old Bank District, technically in the Historic Core. This building was originally home to the Crocker Bank and is positioned on Spring Street, the most popular street for creative types in DTLA, numbers-wise. This area is brimming with creative activity. Nearly countless bars, restaurants, and cafes dot the map nearby along with the post office across the street. The DTLA Art Walk (2nd Thursday of every month) occurs here on Spring Street, largely between 4th-8th Streets. The world famous night club The Exchange is a block away. This building is home to artists, fashion designers, attorneys, accountants, media, marketing/PR, and many more. There's also a hair salon and yoga studio in the building. Excellent amenities including a cafe on the 9th floor (Spring St Cafe), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the Crocker Club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. The building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. There's also on-site management and maintenance. There's shared mens, womens, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access. <br/>
<br/>
THIS IS THE COOLEST &amp; MOST UNIQUE SPACE IN THE BUILDING! And the biggest, for that matter.  Space has POLISHED CEMENT FLOORS along with GORGEOUS WINDOWS.  The space is a CORNER UNIT and the CONFERENCE ROOM (yes there is one) is in the corner.  Incredible picture frame wall and column molding give this space a historic, elegant look, and the raw brick and glass office walls lend itself to a HIGH TECH FEELING ENVIRONMENT.  There's AMAZING SKYLIGHTS that were discovered during renovation.  There's 7 PRIVATE OFFICES!  Reception area as well. Photos speak for themselves!  GREAT NATURAL LIGHT!  There is a HIDDEN SPEAK-EASY BAR/LUNCHROOM in the space as well, and it's complete with a kitchen, full bar, and refrigerator!  The bookshelf is a secret door!  Last but not least, there's a HUGE MEDIA ROOM as well along with an additional private room in there.  <br/>

The biggest thing to come to Broadway in DECADES.  Brand new construction, this building isn't even finished being built yet!  Upstairs are condos for sale.  This listing is for the ground floor retail facing Broadway only, and not the only corner space or space facing 4th St, those are leased.  Amazingly beautiful space with soaring approximately 18 FOOT CEILINGS!  Space currently has cement flooring that can, of course, be polished, or have another flooring added.  Central HVAC is already installed.  Existing plumbing for a private bathroom is in place.  Space is build to suit, per negotiation, landlord can improve the space to meet ones needs.  Floor to ceiling windows flood this space with natural light.  This space is a block away from the famous Grand Central Market.  The building across the street is likely to be demolished to make way for another brand new development.  Around the block on 4th and Spring Street two brand new hotels are openning up, making this one of the most exciting blocks in Downtown LA.  There's infinite possibilities here. This prime retail space could be yours or your clients.  It's here now, but not for long. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY. We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn't meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does.

Anyway this space is accessible from the side walk at the front end off Los Angeles St, shown in the photos. At this entrance there’s a food court and at the end of the passage a minim-mart. The other access point is from Santee Street. This space features windowed frontage, a front reception area, a conference room/office, a back open area with kitchenette, and a back private office. There’s also a storage closest. There’s built in desks that can be kept or removed, per negotiation. Excellent space with exposed ceilings, central HVAC, 24/7 access, great natural light, stylish glass walls, and more. This space shares a common area set of bathrooms on the second floor upstairs. Electricity not included. NNN/CAM INCLUDED!!! Rent rate applies for 1st year only, 2nd year is negotiable. This is a great price-per-square foot! Get it now before someone else swoops it up! Ask the advantages of signing a long lease! On all our listings MINIMAL ONE YEAR LEASE ARE ACCEPTED ONLY, and owner may require a longer than one-year lease for this listing. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY. We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn’t meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does!

All UTILITIES and NNN/CAM INCLUDED!!!<br/>
<br/>
Small GROUND FLOOR single-room retail space with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and SIGNAGE OPPORTUNITY. Exposed ceilings and LARGE BLACK POLISHED TILE FLOORING inside. The flooring is a bit slanted. This building is part of a large lot with a parking lot, parking upstairs, and another 13-story building on the Spring Street Side (parking not included). Located on MAIN STREET between 7th/8th St, this building gets a good amount of drive-by traffic and some walk-by traffic. It's right next to a brand new apartment development, and across the street soon-to-be-finished-renovating Dearden's Building.  It's really hard to ground floor retail space like this at this monthly rate! In fact, it's even hard to find ground floor retail space for $2000! It would be good for an office for no more than two people or a super small store of some kind.  There's already a mini-mart in the building, so no mini-marts allowed.  Space shares a common area restroom inside the parking garage. A/C options available.  24/7 ACCESS.  Get it before someone swoops it up!  On all our listings MINIMAL ONE YEAR leases are accepted only! Ask advantages of signing a 5 year lease! Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY!

NEWLY RENOVATED RESTAURANT SPACE FOR LEASE in SOUTH PASADENA! The famous Rialto Theater has had a phenomenal facelift and the retail has undergone an amazing RENOVATION! This stunning space has been freshly cleaned up and painted. The ceilings are an estimated 18′ HIGH CEILINGS with large windows stretching to the ceiling! MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF NATURAL LIGHT flood this space, and what a BEAUTIFUL SPACE it is. It features an existing functioning VENT/HOOD along with multiple sinks. There’s a countertop that opens from the kitchen/cooking area right into the space. INFINITE POSSIBILITIES for restaurant/café spaces for this space. Located in an EXCELLENT LOCATION with TONS OF DRIVE-BY TRAFFIC! As far as permits go, due diligence has yet to have been done regarding whether they are active or not. Yet, for qualified Lessee’s Lessor may consider a free rent period if any permit work is needed. Space features an ADA size bathroom (Lessee to verify) along with a small bathroom in the kitchen. There’s a second floor storage area as well that’s approximately 120sf, and is included in the quoted rent rate. I imagine a restaurant/café concept that does a lot of take-out and delivery would find this opportunity the most attractive since there is limited space for seating. Get it before someone else comes and takes this hot opportunity off the market! Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY! We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn’t meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does! Please call/text 213-304-4727 now! Thank you!
