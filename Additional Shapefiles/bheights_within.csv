we have one private bedroom with a private bath available in a 3 bedroom house in boyle heights (this bedroom is furnished, although design has changed).  roommates names are josh and pedram. mid's 20. college educated and creative. one of us is from north carolina and the other roomie is a military veteran. <br/>
<br/>
the place isn't glam, but its a great place to live and have your own private bathroom. <br/>
<br/>
near all the major freeways: 5, 10, 60, 101, and 110. dtla and arts district is just a short 5–10 minute drive (it's not a bad walk or bike ride either). accessible to lots of bus routes that have stops on soto or chavez blvd. the gold line soto rail station is near.<br/>
<br/>
this room is currently on a month-to-month term. rent is $850 due on the first of each month plus share the utilities (water, sewer, electric, trash) that's about an additional $70.<br/>
<br/>
please contact me (jess) if you are interested so we can arrange to show you the place and/or answer any questions you may have first. it would also be helpful if you tell us a little about yourself!    </section>", (Boyle Heights),$850,,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-private-bathroom-furnished/7322043633.html,34.0245,-118.1975,POINT (-118.1975 34.0245),private,True

this is one private room in a 3 bedroom space. the room has its own (big and clean!) bathroom with sink, two bathroom cabinets, toilet and fully functioning shower and tub. the bedroom is already furnished with a bed, desk (with desk chair) and nightstand. it also has its own walk-in closet. <br/>
<br/>
the kitchen has an electric stove, a refrigerator with a freezer, a sink, a dishwasher and four high chairs (that come with the room). the living room right next to the kitchen has a large couch (also comes with the apartment) and a central table. there is also a balcony with a view that faces the pool. all of these would be shared with the other people living in the unit (usually up to 3 people).<br/>
<br/>
currently one female is living in one of the rooms in this unit. i would prefer a younger female for this unit.<br/>
<br/>
this would be a sublet for two months (june and july). if you like living there and are staying in la you can get rent for a year and it would be at the same price. currently there is no security deposit, previously it was $500.<br/>
<br/>
the building is on the usc health sciences campus between lincoln heights and boyle heights. it is about a 10 minute drive east to the nearest suburb, alhambra. pasadena is a 20 minute drive east. downtown la is about 10 minutes west. griffith park and observatory are about 20 minutes north. burbank is 30 minutes north.    </section>"," (USC health sciences campus, Los Angeles, CA)","$1,285",1.0,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/sub/d/los-angeles-currie-hall-usc-health/7323982811.html,34.063361,-118.200665,POINT (-118.200665 34.063361),private,True

first off, we are not desperate to fill this room; we are just looking for the right fit for our home.<br/>
<br/>
we have a big house (2,300sq ft) located less than 1 mile from usc-hsc campus and la county hospital. close to downtown and the arts district. also 4 blocks from the metro gold line. we are renting out 1 of the large (150sq ft) bedrooms for $900, plus utilities (about $70/month). close to public transit and i-10, i-5, and 101. down the street is the main stretch of businesses on cesar chavez such as: guisados's, george's burgers, brooklyn pizza, king taco, walgreens, a cool local book store and record store, and a delicious (and cheap) juice bar!<br/>
<br/>
our kitchen is large and spacious. large front patio and back yard oasis with a pergola, firepit, and landscaping. plenty of storage on site that you are free to use. washer/dryer in the basement.<br/>
<br/>
ideal for a very clean and professional adult. <br/>
no pets please. no subleasing. not a party house.<br/>
we do have our occasional get togethers and such in the back yard, but it is definitely not a regular thing. we are all rather quiet and respectful of others' time and space in the home. <br/>
<br/>
month to month<br/>
<br/>
you will need first month rent and deposit of $500 ($1,400 total to move in) and proof of income. if interested, send me an email! <br/>
