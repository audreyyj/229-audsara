Not all apartment communities are created equal. To stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. First, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. Second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. So what makes Valley Street Apartments special?<br/><br/>
When you come home to Valley St. Apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. Assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. You'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. Our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/><br/>
You'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver Lake. Our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic Los Angeles landmarks, and so much more. And with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/><br/>
Maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. If so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. Contact us online or by phone today.

Not all apartment communities are created equal. To stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. First, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. Second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. So what makes Valley Street Apartments special?<br/>
When you come home to Valley St. Apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. Assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. You'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. Our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/>
<br/>
You'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver Lake. Our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic Los Angeles landmarks, and so much more. And with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. If so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. Contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

Not all apartment communities are created equal. To stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. First, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. Second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. So what makes Valley Street Apartments special?<br/><br/>
When you come home to Valley St. Apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. Assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. You'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. Our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/><br/>
You'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver Lake. Our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic Los Angeles landmarks, and so much more. And with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/><br/>
Maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. If so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. Contact us online or by phone today.

Not all apartment communities are created equal. To stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. First, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. Second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. So what makes Valley Street Apartments special?<br/>
When you come home to Valley St. Apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. Assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. You'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. Our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/>
<br/>
You'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver Lake. Our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic Los Angeles landmarks, and so much more. And with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. If so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. Contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

<br/><br/>Not all apartment communities are created equal. To stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. First, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. Second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. So what makes Valley Street Apartments special?<br/><br/>
When you come home to Valley St. Apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. Assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. You'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. Our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/><br/>
You'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver Lake. Our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic Los Angeles landmarks, and so much more. And with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/><br/>
Maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. If so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. Contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

This lovely furnished rental is located in Koreatown, a trendy LA neighborhood with amazing proximity and much to offer.

You certainly won’t have trouble finding a bite to eat or a place to relax at the end of the evening with hip bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. The area's multiple Metro stops makes hopping between Koreatown's attractions all the easier from Western to Vermont, and Beverly to Olympic.<br/>

Not all apartment communities are created equal. To stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. First, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. Second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. So what makes Valley Street Apartments special?<br/><br/>
When you come home to Valley St. Apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. Assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. You'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. Our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/><br/>
You'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver Lake. Our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic Los Angeles landmarks, and so much more. And with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/><br/>
Maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. If so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. Contact us online or by phone today.

<br/>Each unit features original hardwood floors, high ceilings with original crown molding and unique built-ins. There is the vintage feel in the building but with a cool modern twist.  Concrete accent walls and updated appliances take these typical 1920’s units from classic to wow.

</div>
Hi everyone. Looking for a new roommate for my one bedroom with a loft. I live upstairs in my open loft next to the 2nd story balcony. The bedroom is private with it's own bathroom, but it is unfurnished. My stove, fridge, and microwave can be shared and I will be paying for all utility bills. Rent will be $1000, but I may be willing to lower it (slightly). <br/>
<br/>
Little about me, I am a poc, lgbt friendly, and extremely friendly (can be opinionated though). I try to live by the 3 ""C's"" (cool, calm, and collected :-) . I work in the entertainment field, but jobs have been slow in the last year. When I start back I likely will be working from home again, so I will be their most of the time. Looking for a chill person, that keeps the common areas clean, don't have many guests, and has no kids (sorry bad experience with a roomy). I prefer someone in their 20's and 30's, but definitely open to older or younger.<br/>
<br/>
A credit check and application are required by the property management, so please be prepared. If you have any more questions feel free to ask me at the provided number (text only) or email. I will only be accepting text and emails until we see if we're a match. Thanks for reading the ad and hope it wasn't to long :-)<br/>

<big><b>Welcome to Valley Street Apartments--Finding Home At Valley Street!</b></big><br/>
<br/>
<i>Not all apartment communities are created equal. To stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. First, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. Second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. So what makes Valley Street Apartments special?<br/><br/>
When you come home to Valley St. Apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. Assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. You'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. Our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/><br/>
You'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver Lake. Our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic Los Angeles landmarks, and so much more. And with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/><br/>
Maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. If so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. Contact us online or by phone today.</i>

<b>Description</b>
<blockquote>
    Create a lovely home at the Chateau Duval, the most distinctive, gorgeous building on the block in LA's Koreatown. Built in 1929 and well maintained, the Chateau Duval has beautifully renovated yet affordable studio and 1 bedroom apartments.
<br/>Cross the threshold and the first thing you’ll notice is the quiet and friendly atmosphere. 
<br/>Each unit features original hardwood floors, high ceilings with original crown molding and unique built-ins. There is the vintage feel in the building but with a cool modern twist.  Concrete accent walls and updated appliances take these typical 1920’s units from classic to wow. 
<br/>
<br/>A purrfect home for your feline family member.

Ultimately, home is all about the details. For an apartment home to be unique, it needs more than just a reasonable amount of living space; it needs amenities that enrich your life, in a place that enhances your experiences. At Grandview Towers, those details are our priority.<br/>
<br/>
As you explore your new apartment home, you'll notice a wide variety of thoughtful amenities. Look up and you'll see soaring vaulted ceilings, which create a feeling of space. Look down and you'll see immaculate hardwood and tile flooring. Run your hand along smooth granite countertops, and your eye can't help but wander to stainless steel appliances.<br/>
<br/>
Just steps away lies our fitness center, providing plenty of opportunities to help sustain your busy lifestyle.

Not all apartment communities are created equal. To stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. First, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. Second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. So what makes Valley Street Apartments special?<br/><br/>
When you come home to Valley St. Apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. Assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. You'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. Our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/><br/>
You'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver Lake. Our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic Los Angeles landmarks, and so much more. And with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/><br/>
Maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. If so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. Contact us online or by phone today.

About me: I'll be your roommate living in the other bedroom. Male (he/him/his), late 20s, grad student at USC School of Cinematic Arts and working part-time in the film industry, extremely clean and quiet, usually out and about, either on set, at school, or galavanting around LA, photographer and gardener (obviously, I mean look at those plants), non-smoker, respectful of your space and belongings, always down to hangout and grab a drink!<br/>
<br/>
Who I'm looking for: Working professional, 25-40, and CLEAN! Truly not asking for the world, just that you don't leave dishes in the sink and mop the floor occasionally. You know, basic adulting stuff. That you're respectfully quiet (eg not blasting music at odd hours of the night). That you don't smoke (the infrequent hard-day-at-work balcony joint accepted, I'm not a monster), and no pets please.<br/>
<br/>
Rent is $1825 plus utilities and deposit is $540. Looking for a long-term roomie who can stick around for at least a year. You'll need to submit a rental application for approval.<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested, please email me with ""NEW ROOMIE INTERESTED"" in the subject so that I know you read all this wonderful info and include your Instagram or Facebook handle. I'd love to chat with you on Zoom and maybe set up a visit if you want! I'm fully vaccinated!<br/>

We now have available a beautiful 1920's French Normandie Style single. This unique single is ample with 700 sq. ft., vaulted ceilings, custom color paint, crown molding, concrete floors, and plenty of natural sunlights. Included in this unit you have a vanity area, plenty of closets with lots of space for storage. Kitchen comes with a stove, granite counters with a beautiful light fixture over the dining area. Building is centrally located within distance from gas stations, Koreatown Plaza, park, metro red line, and freeways. Close by to Ralphs, 24 hour Fitness, and CVS Pharmacy. Building is pet friendly. Cats allowed with an additional $200 deposit and dogs with an additional $300 deposit. Gas and electric included. Truly a one of kind living experience.<br/>

Not all apartment communities are created equal. To stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. First, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. Second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. So what makes Valley Street Apartments special?<br/><br/>
When you come home to Valley St. Apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. Assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. You'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. Our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/><br/>
You'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver Lake. Our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic Los Angeles landmarks, and so much more. And with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/><br/>
Maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. If so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. Contact us online or by phone today.
