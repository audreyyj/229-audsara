<br/>ABOUT 150 N Soto Street Property
<br/>
<br/>Our location is in the heart of Boyle Heights, a neighborhood just East of Downtown LA (just over one mile to the Arts District across the LA River). The lifestyle here is very rich in urban amenities styling itself after it's Brooklyn namesake. The street is very walk-able with an eclectic and vibrant mix of locally owned retail shops and restaurants in abundance. Get serenaded by live Mariachi music while sipping a Horchata from locally owned restaurants on the street!
<br/>
<br/>This apartment is all inclusive and fully furnished and all utilities are paid for by the owner. Units have laminate flooring, vertical blinds, ceiling fan, new fridge and microwave, queen sized bed, and are freshly painted. Common area kitchen is located on each floor and is available for everybody to use.
<br/>
<br/>Well served by public transportation: Walk 2 minutes to Soto light rail station straight to Arts District, Little Tokyo, or no time to catch a bus to DTLA. It is incredibly easy to get around this town!
<br/>
<br/>Approval is based on income (must show proof of income at least twice the monthly rent), rental history, criminal background (no felonies), &amp; NO evictions. Credit scores are not as important as these other factors in evaluating applications. Please apply today!

Not all apartment communities are created equal. To stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. First, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. Second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. So what makes Valley Street Apartments special?<br/><br/>
When you come home to Valley St. Apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. Assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. You'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. Our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/><br/>
You'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver Lake. Our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic Los Angeles landmarks, and so much more. And with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/><br/>
Maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. If so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. Contact us online or by phone today.

Seeking a potential long term new roomate to share my home with. Current roomate will be leaving . I keep to myself alot and would be nice to find someone who is similar. Ideally I would like to have a hard working clean and respectful roomate willing to share household duties etc.. I am a pretty chill easy going guy, I smoke weed and enjoy a good drink and all outdoor things.. have a big garden and lots of house plants. There is some storage space but not alot so its best if you dont have too many loose odds and ends. The basement space is unfurnished and is a pretty sweet space for you to set up and decorate as you like. I am in the middle of repainting the whole house as well so hope you like the colors.Contact here <a class=""show-contact"" data-href=""/reply/lax/roo/7324282433/__SERVICE_ID__"" href=""#"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""click to show contact info"">show contact info</a>

Pets are a pssibility so long as you are a responsible owner. I have compost and garden beds in the back so any dogs will have to be well behaved and not let out unattended.<br/>
Laundry is in the basement bathroom so to a degree the space is somewhat shared for laundry usage.<br/>
That covers most of it. If your interested shoot me a message and we can see of we connect well and then proceed from there. I am having trouble loading pictures but will get som up soon.    </section>"," (BOYLE HEIGHTS, LOS ANGELES)",$0,,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/wst/roo/d/los-angeles-400-furnished-bedroom-in-xl/7324282433.html,34.030147,-118.208658

You'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. Our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/><br/>
You'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver Lake. Our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic Los Angeles landmarks, and so much more. And with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/><br/>

Seeking a potential long term new roomate to share my home with. Current roomate will be leaving . I keep to myself alot and would be nice to find someone who is similar. Ideally I would like to have a hard working clean and respectful roomate willing to share household duties etc.. I am a pretty chill easy going guy, I smoke weed and enjoy a good drink and all outdoor things.. have a big garden and lots of house plants. There is some storage space but not alot so its best if you dont have too many loose odds and ends. The basement space is unfurnished and is a pretty sweet space for you to set up and decorate as you like. I am in the middle of repainting the whole house as well so hope you like the colors.Contact here <a class=""show-contact"" data-href=""/reply/lax/roo/7324750975/__SERVICE_ID__"" href=""#"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""click to show contact info"">show contact info</a>

Pets are a pssibility so long as you are a responsible owner. I have compost and garden beds in the back so any dogs will have to be well behaved and not let out unattended.<br/>
Laundry is in the basement bathroom so to a degree the space is somewhat shared for laundry usage.<br/>
That covers most of it. If your interested shoot me a message and we can see of we connect well and then proceed from there.

We have one private bedroom with a private bath available in a 3 bedroom house in Boyle Heights (this bedroom is furnished, although design has changed).  Roommates names are Josh and Pedram. Mid's 20. College educated and creative. One of us is from North Carolina and the other roomie is a military veteran. <br/>
<br/>
The place isn't glam, but its a great place to live and have your own private bathroom. <br/>
<br/>
Near all the major freeways: 5, 10, 60, 101, and 110. DTLA and Arts District is just a short 5–10 minute drive (it's not a bad walk or bike ride either). Accessible to lots of bus routes that have stops on Soto or Chavez Blvd. The Gold Line Soto rail station is near.<br/>
<br/>
This room is currently on a month-to-month term. Rent is $850 due on the first of each month plus share the utilities (water, sewer, electric, trash) that's about an additional $70.<br/>
<br/>
Please contact me (Jess) if you are interested so we can arrange to show you the place and/or answer any questions you may have first. It would also be helpful if you tell us a little about yourself!    </section>", (Boyle Heights),$850,,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-private-bathroom-furnished/7322043633.html,34.024500,-118.197500

Just steps away lies our fitness center, providing plenty of opportunities to help sustain your busy lifestyle. Look a little further at immaculately kept landscaping, where you can mingle and meet new friends and old. Look further yet, and you'll see you're surrounded by the diverse and laid-back community of Westlake. Parks, restaurants, and museums are available, and you're less than two minutes from downtown Los Angeles.<br/><br/>

Not all apartment communities are created equal. To stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. First, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. Second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. So what makes Valley Street Apartments special?<br/>
When you come home to Valley St. Apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. Assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. You'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. Our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/>
<br/>
You'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver Lake. Our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic Los Angeles landmarks, and so much more. And with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. If so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. Contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

Ultimately, home is all about the details. For an apartment home to be unique, it needs more than just a reasonable amount of living space; it needs amenities that enrich your life, in a place that enhances your experiences. At Grandview Towers, those details are our priority.<br/>
<br/>
As you explore your new apartment home, you'll notice a wide variety of thoughtful amenities. Look up and you'll see soaring vaulted ceilings, which create a feeling of space. Look down and you'll see immaculate hardwood and tile flooring. Run your hand along smooth granite countertops, and your eye can't help but wander to stainless steel appliances.<br/>
<br/>
Just steps away lies our fitness center, providing plenty of opportunities to help sustain your busy lifestyle. Look a little further at immaculately kept landscaping, where you can mingle and meet new friends and old. Look further yet, and you'll see you're surrounded by the diverse and laid-back community of Westlake. Parks, restaurants, and museums are available, and you're less than two minutes from downtown Los Angeles.<br/>
<br/>
Home is all about the details. If you're ready to take advantage of them, we're ready to have you. For more information about leasing, contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

Not all apartment communities are created equal. To stand out in a highly competitive field, there are two factors a successful community needs to focus on. First, they need to offer amenities that, quite simply, you can't live without. Second, the community needs to be located somewhere desirable. So what makes Valley Street Apartments special?<br/>
When you come home to Valley St. Apartments, you'll enjoy a place that's designed with comfort, convenience, and functionality in mind. Assigned parking spaces means that the days of endlessly hunting for a place to park are over. You'll see that hardwood flooring and a suite of kitchen appliances allow you to experience the convenience and comfort of modern living. Our fitness center lets you stay active no matter the weather, and on-site laundry facilities reduce the annoyance of that one chore.<br/>
<br/>
You'll find us between the popular neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver Lake. Our community offers many parks, shopping options, historic Los Angeles landmarks, and so much more. And with access to the wider world through easy freeway access and convenient commuter rail stations, exploring your new neighborhood has never been easier.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this sounds perfect for you and your family and you're ready to join us, making here your next home. If so, you'll want to act fast, because our apartments won't last long and demand is high. Contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

Ultimately, home is all about the details. For an apartment home to be unique, it needs more than just a reasonable amount of living space; it needs amenities that enrich your life, in a place that enhances your experiences. At Grandview Towers, those details are our priority.<br/>
<br/>
As you explore your new apartment home, you'll notice a wide variety of thoughtful amenities. Look up and you'll see soaring vaulted ceilings, which create a feeling of space. Look down and you'll see immaculate hardwood and tile flooring. Run your hand along smooth granite countertops, and your eye can't help but wander to stainless steel appliances.<br/>
<br/>
Just steps away lies our fitness center, providing plenty of opportunities to help sustain your busy lifestyle. Look a little further at immaculately kept landscaping, where you can mingle and meet new friends and old. Look further yet, and you'll see you're surrounded by the diverse and laid-back community of Westlake. Parks, restaurants, and museums are available, and you're less than two minutes from downtown Los Angeles.<br/>
<br/>
Home is all about the details. If you're ready to take advantage of them, we're ready to have you. For more information about leasing, contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

This is one private room in a 3 bedroom space. The room has its own (big and clean!) bathroom with sink, two bathroom cabinets, toilet and fully functioning shower and tub. The bedroom is already furnished with a bed, desk (with desk chair) and nightstand. It also has its own walk-in closet. <br/>
<br/>
The kitchen has an electric stove, a refrigerator with a freezer, a sink, a dishwasher and four high chairs (that come with the room). The living room right next to the kitchen has a large couch (also comes with the apartment) and a central table. There is also a balcony with a view that faces the pool. All of these would be shared with the other people living in the unit (usually up to 3 people).<br/>
<br/>
Currently one female is living in one of the rooms in this unit. I would prefer a younger female for this unit.<br/>
<br/>
This would be a sublet for two months (June and July). If you like living there and are staying in LA you can get rent for a year and it would be at the same price. Currently there is no security deposit, previously it was $500.<br/>
<br/>
The building is on the USC health sciences campus between Lincoln Heights and Boyle Heights. It is about a 10 minute drive east to the nearest suburb, Alhambra. Pasadena is a 20 minute drive east. Downtown LA is about 10 minutes west. Griffith Park and Observatory are about 20 minutes north. Burbank is 30 minutes north.    </section>"," (USC health sciences campus, Los Angeles, CA)","$1,285",1.0,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/sub/d/los-angeles-currie-hall-usc-health/7323982811.html,34.063361,-118.200665

Incredible 12-story creative office building located on Gallery Row, in Downtown LA’s Old Bank District, technically in the Historic Core. This building was originally home to the Crocker Bank and is positioned on Spring Street, the most popular street for creative types in DTLA, numbers-wise. This area is brimming with creative activity. Nearly countless bars, restaurants, and cafes dot the map nearby along with the post office across the street. The DTLA Art Walk (2nd Thursday of every month) occurs here on Spring Street, largely between 4th-8th Streets. The world famous night club The Exchange is a block away. This building is home to artists, fashion designers, attorneys, accountants, media, marketing/PR, and many more. There’s also a hair salon and yoga studio in the building. Excellent amenities including a café on the 9th floor (Café 9), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the Crocker Club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. All white walls, and natural light. The building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. There’s also on-site management and maintenance. There’s shared men’s, women’s, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access. The majority of the units have exposed ceilings, polished cement floors, large windows flooding the space with light, and track lighting.

SPACE WILL HAVE NEW LIGHTING! (not shown in photos)<br/>
<br/>
Incredible 12-story creative office building located on Gallery Row, in Downtown LA's Old Bank District, technically in the Historic Core. This building was originally home to the Crocker Bank and is positioned on Spring Street, the most popular street for creative types in DTLA, numbers-wise.

This building is home to artists, fashion designers, attorneys, accountants, media, marketing/PR, and many more. There's also a hair salon and yoga studio in the building. Excellent amenities including a cafe on the 9th floor (Cafe 9), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the Crocker Club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. The building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. There's also on-site management and maintenance. There's shared mens, womens, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access. The majority of the units have exposed ceilings, polished cement floors, large windows flooding the space with light, and track lighting. <br/>

BROADWAY! The most up and coming street in DTLA! Area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. You want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! Location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  This building is also across the street from the ROXIE, CAMEO, &amp; ARCADE THEATERS! These are just three of the many historic theaters on Broadway!  Broadway was the original Hollywood and stars like Charlie Chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. The Spring Arcade FOOD HALL is also located across the street. Incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the Bringing Back Broadway organization. Only signage allowed on Broadway is now NEON! <br/>
<br/>
GROUND FLOOR: Has SOARING CEILINGS!  There's CENTRAL HVAC along with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and a metal roll-up door for security. Space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. Space can be used for any kind of permitted RETAIL SPACE or OFFICE SPACE. Space is IDEAL FOR AN ART GALLERY! Other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! Space has PRIVATE BATHROOM! There's also 3 OFFICES in the back! Smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
BASEMENT: Basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. It has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. Technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. Doesn't have HVAC at the moment.<br/>
<br/>

The biggest thing to come to Broadway in DECADES.  Brand new construction, this building isn't even finished being built yet!  Upstairs are condos for sale.  This listing is for the ground floor retail facing Broadway only, and not the only corner space or space facing 4th St, those are leased.  Amazingly beautiful space with soaring approximately 18 FOOT CEILINGS!  Space currently has cement flooring that can, of course, be polished, or have another flooring added.  Central HVAC is already installed.  Existing plumbing for a private bathroom is in place.  Space is build to suit, per negotiation, landlord can improve the space to meet ones needs.  Floor to ceiling windows flood this space with natural light.  This space is a block away from the famous Grand Central Market.  The building across the street is likely to be demolished to make way for another brand new development.  Around the block on 4th and Spring Street two brand new hotels are openning up, making this one of the most exciting blocks in Downtown LA.  There's infinite possibilities here. This prime retail space could be yours or your clients.  It's here now, but not for long. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY. We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn't meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does.

BROADWAY! The most up and coming street in DTLA! Area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. You want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! Location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  This building is also across the street from the ROXIE, CAMEO, &amp; ARCADE THEATERS! These are just three of the many historic theaters on Broadway!  Broadway was the original Hollywood and stars like Charlie Chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. The Spring Arcade FOOD HALL is also located across the street. Incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the Bringing Back Broadway organization. Only signage allowed on Broadway is now NEON! <br/>

<br/>
BASEMENT: Basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. It has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting.

Small GROUND FLOOR single-room retail space with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and SIGNAGE OPPORTUNITY. Exposed ceilings and LARGE BLACK POLISHED TILE FLOORING inside. The flooring is a bit slanted. This building is part of a large lot with a parking lot, parking upstairs, and another 13-story building on the Spring Street Side (parking not included). Located on MAIN STREET between 7th/8th St, this building gets a good amount of drive-by traffic and some walk-by traffic. It's right next to a brand new apartment development, and across the street soon-to-be-finished-renovating Dearden's Building.  It's really hard to ground floor retail space like this at this monthly rate! In fact, it's even hard to find ground floor retail space for $2000! It would be good for an office for no more than two people or a super small store of some kind.  There's already a mini-mart in the building, so no mini-marts allowed.  Space shares a common area restroom inside the parking garage. A/C options available.  24/7 ACCESS.  Get it before someone swoops it up!

First off, we are not desperate to fill this room; we are just looking for the right fit for our home.<br/>
<br/>
We have a BIG house (2,300sq ft) located less than 1 mile from USC-HSC campus and LA County hospital. Close to Downtown and the Arts District. Also 4 blocks from the Metro Gold Line. We are renting out 1 of the large (150sq ft) bedrooms for $900, plus utilities (about $70/month). Close to public transit and I-10, I-5, and 101. Down the street is the main stretch of businesses on Cesar Chavez such as: Guisados's, George's Burgers, Brooklyn Pizza, King Taco, Walgreens, a cool local book store and record store, and a delicious (and cheap) juice bar!<br/>
<br/>
Our kitchen is large and spacious. Large front patio and back yard oasis with a pergola, firepit, and landscaping. Plenty of storage on site that you are free to use. Washer/dryer in the basement.<br/>
<br/>
Ideal for a very clean and professional adult. <br/>
NO PETS please. NO subleasing. NOT a party house.<br/>
We do have our occasional get togethers and such in the back yard, but it is definitely not a regular thing. We are all rather quiet and respectful of others' time and space in the home. <br/>
<br/>
Month to Month<br/>
<br/>
You will need first month rent and deposit of $500 ($1,400 total to move in) and proof of income. If interested, send me an email! <br/>
<br/>
Serious inquiries only.<br/>

Ultimately, home is all about the details. For an apartment home to be unique, it needs more than just a reasonable amount of living space; it needs amenities that enrich your life, in a place that enhances your experiences. At Grandview Towers, those details are our priority.<br/>
<br/>
As you explore your new apartment home, you'll notice a wide variety of thoughtful amenities. Look up and you'll see soaring vaulted ceilings, which create a feeling of space. Look down and you'll see immaculate hardwood and tile flooring. Run your hand along smooth granite countertops, and your eye can't help but wander to stainless steel appliances.<br/>
<br/>
Just steps away lies our fitness center, providing plenty of opportunities to help sustain your busy lifestyle. Look a little further at immaculately kept landscaping, where you can mingle and meet new friends and old. Look further yet, and you'll see you're surrounded by the diverse and laid-back community of Westlake. Parks, restaurants, and museums are available, and you're less than two minutes from downtown Los Angeles.<br/>
<br/>
Home is all about the details. If you're ready to take advantage of them, we're ready to have you. For more information about leasing, contact us online or by phone today.<br/>

<br/>ABOUT 150 N Soto Street Property
<br/>
<br/>Our location is in the heart of Boyle Heights, a neighborhood just East of Downtown LA (just over one mile to the Arts District across the LA River). The lifestyle here is very rich in urban amenities styling itself after it's Brooklyn namesake. The street is very walk-able with an eclectic and vibrant mix of locally owned retail shops and restaurants in abundance. Get serenaded by live Mariachi music while sipping a Horchata from locally owned restaurants on the street!
<br/>
<br/>This apartment is all inclusive and fully furnished and all utilities are paid for by the owner. Units have laminate flooring, vertical blinds, ceiling fan, new fridge and microwave, queen sized bed, and are freshly painted. Common area kitchen is located on each floor and is available for everybody to use.
<br/>
<br/>Well served by public transportation: Walk 2 minutes to Soto light rail station straight to Arts District, Little Tokyo, or no time to catch a bus to DTLA. It is incredibly easy to get around this town!
<br/>
<br/>Approval is based on income (must show proof of income at least twice the monthly rent), rental history, criminal background (no felonies), &amp; NO evictions. Credit scores are not as important as these other factors in evaluating applications. Please apply today!

Incredible 12-story creative office building located on Gallery Row, in Downtown LA’s Old Bank District, technically in the Historic Core. This building was originally home to the Crocker Bank and is positioned on Spring Street, the most popular street for creative types in DTLA, numbers-wise. This area is brimming with creative activity. Nearly countless bars, restaurants, and cafes dot the map nearby along with the post office across the street. The DTLA Art Walk (2nd Thursday of every month) occurs here on Spring Street, largely between 4th-8th Streets. The world famous night club The Exchange is a block away. This building is home to artists, fashion designers, attorneys, accountants, media, marketing/PR, and many more. There’s also a hair salon and yoga studio in the building. Excellent amenities including a café on the 9th floor (Café 9), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the Crocker Club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. All white walls, and natural light. The building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. There’s also on-site management and maintenance. There’s shared men’s, women’s, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access. The majority of the units have exposed ceilings, polished cement floors, large windows flooding the space with light, and track lighting. Per negotiation, Landlord can modify and improve the spaces to meet your needs. On all our listings MINIMAL ONE YEAR leases are accepted only! Owner may require a longer than one-year lease for this listing. If available, ask about the advantages of signing a 3 YEAR LEASE! Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY!

BROADWAY! The most up and coming street in DTLA! Area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. You want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! Location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  This building is also across the street from the ROXIE, CAMEO, &amp; ARCADE THEATERS! These are just three of the many historic theaters on Broadway!  Broadway was the original Hollywood and stars like Charlie Chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. The Spring Arcade FOOD HALL is also located across the street. Incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the Bringing Back Broadway organization. Only signage allowed on Broadway is now NEON! <br/>
<br/>
GROUND FLOOR: Has SOARING CEILINGS!  There's CENTRAL HVAC along with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and a metal roll-up door for security. Space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. Space can be used for any kind of permitted RETAIL SPACE or OFFICE SPACE. Space is IDEAL FOR AN ART GALLERY! Other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! Space has PRIVATE BATHROOM! There's also 3 OFFICES in the back! Smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
BASEMENT: Basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. It has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. Technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. Doesn't have HVAC at the moment.<br/>
<br/>

Amazingly beautiful space with soaring approximately 18 FOOT CEILINGS!  Space currently has cement flooring that can, of course, be polished, or have another flooring added.  Central HVAC is already installed.  Existing plumbing for a private bathroom is in place.  Space is build to suit, per negotiation, landlord can improve the space to meet ones needs.  Floor to ceiling windows flood this space with natural light.  This space is a block away from the famous Grand Central Market.  The building across the street is likely to be demolished to make way for another brand new development.  Around the block on 4th and Spring Street two brand new hotels are openning up, making this one of the most exciting blocks in Downtown LA.  There's infinite possibilities here. This prime retail space could be yours or your clients.  It's here now, but not for long. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY.

BROADWAY! The most up and coming street in DTLA! Area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. You want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! Location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  This building is also across the street from the ROXIE, CAMEO, &amp; ARCADE THEATERS! These are just three of the many historic theaters on Broadway!  Broadway was the original Hollywood and stars like Charlie Chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. The Spring Arcade FOOD HALL is also located across the street. Incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the Bringing Back Broadway organization. Only signage allowed on Broadway is now NEON! <br/>
<br/>
GROUND FLOOR: Has SOARING CEILINGS!  There's CENTRAL HVAC along with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and a metal roll-up door for security. Space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. Space can be used for any kind of permitted RETAIL SPACE or OFFICE SPACE. Space is IDEAL FOR AN ART GALLERY! Other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! Space has PRIVATE BATHROOM! There's also 3 OFFICES in the back! Smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
BASEMENT: Basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. It has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting.

Incredible 12-story creative office building located on Gallery Row, in Downtown LA’s Old Bank District, technically in the Historic Core. This building was originally home to the Crocker Bank and is positioned on Spring Street, the most popular street for creative types in DTLA, numbers-wise. This area is brimming with creative activity. Nearly countless bars, restaurants, and cafes dot the map nearby along with the post office across the street. The DTLA Art Walk (2nd Thursday of every month) occurs here on Spring Street, largely between 4th-8th Streets. The world famous night club The Exchange is a block away. This building is home to artists, fashion designers, attorneys, accountants, media, marketing/PR, and many more. There’s also a hair salon and yoga studio in the building. Excellent amenities including a café on the 9th floor (Café 9), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the Crocker Club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. All white walls, and natural light. The building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. There’s also on-site management and maintenance. There’s shared men’s, women’s, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access. The majority of the units have exposed ceilings, polished cement floors, large windows flooding the space with light, and track lighting. Per negotiation, Landlord can modify and improve the spaces to meet your needs. On all our listings MINIMAL ONE YEAR leases are accepted only! Owner may require a longer than one-year lease for this listing. If available, ask about the advantages of signing a 3 YEAR LEASE! Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY! We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn’t meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does!

Unit 716 is a CORNER SPACE and has immediate visibility from the elevator from the parking garage.  As a corner space it gets natural light from two sides, and the unit has TONS OF WINDOWED FRONTAGE that could be used as advertising space.  It features it's on spot for signage and tons of outdoor seating available in the plaza.  This space was previously occupied by a CREDIT UNION so it's basically built out like a BANK SPACE.  The photos show the space as it is presently.  Another bank would be an excellent fit, but ANY PERMITTED USE IS POSSIBLE!  Per negotiation, landlord can deliver the space as an empty blank shell for a tenant wishing to use the space for a different use, such as medical office, dental office, and more. For well tenants who are well established and have excellent finances, landlord can, per negotiation, contribute to tenant improvements, aside from a basic demo.  It's also possible to subdivide the space into two units roughly 1100sf and 2000sf each.  The space currently has central HVAC, 2 private bathrooms, a server room, a lunch room, a teller station area, and a huge open area with divisions for desks.  Retail tenants have 24/7 access to the space and plaza. There’s a parking garage for the building as well where people can park for a daily fee of $10 of $200 monthly. It is also possible for retail tenants to validate their customers parking as well! Ask me the advantages of signing a five-year lease! On all our listings MINIMAL ONE YEAR LEASE ARE ACCEPTED ONLY, and owner may require a longer than one-year lease for this listing. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY.

Incredible 12-story creative office building located on Gallery Row, in Downtown LA's Old Bank District, technically in the Historic Core. This building was originally home to the Crocker Bank and is positioned on Spring Street, the most popular street for creative types in DTLA, numbers-wise. This area is brimming with creative activity. Nearly countless bars, restaurants, and cafes dot the map nearby along with the post office across the street. The DTLA Art Walk (2nd Thursday of every month) occurs here on Spring Street, largely between 4th-8th Streets. The world famous night club The Exchange is a block away. This building is home to artists, fashion designers, attorneys, accountants, media, marketing/PR, and many more. There's also a hair salon and yoga studio in the building. Excellent amenities including a cafe on the 9th floor (Spring St Cafe), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the Crocker Club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. The building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. There's also on-site management and maintenance. There's shared mens, womens, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access. <br/>
<br/>
THIS IS THE COOLEST &amp; MOST UNIQUE SPACE IN THE BUILDING! And the biggest, for that matter.  Space has POLISHED CEMENT FLOORS along with GORGEOUS WINDOWS.  The space is a CORNER UNIT and the CONFERENCE ROOM (yes there is one) is in the corner.  Incredible picture frame wall and column molding give this space a historic, elegant look, and the raw brick and glass office walls lend itself to a HIGH TECH FEELING ENVIRONMENT.  There's AMAZING SKYLIGHTS that were discovered during renovation.  There's 7 PRIVATE OFFICES!  Reception area as well. Photos speak for themselves!  GREAT NATURAL LIGHT!  There is a HIDDEN SPEAK-EASY BAR/LUNCHROOM in the space as well, and it's complete with a kitchen, full bar, and refrigerator!  The bookshelf is a secret door!  Last but not least, there's a HUGE MEDIA ROOM as well along with an additional private room in there.  <br/>
<br/>
Per negotiation, Landlord can modify and improve the spaces to meet your needs. Ask me the advantages of signing a five-year lease!

BROADWAY! The most up and coming street in DTLA! Area has a tremendous amount of character and creativity to it. You want your thoughts provoked on a block, this will do it! Location is very popular by millennials and young professionals.  This building is also across the street from the ROXIE, CAMEO, &amp; ARCADE THEATERS! These are just three of the many historic theaters on Broadway!  Broadway was the original Hollywood and stars like Charlie Chaplin strolled down these sidewalks. The Spring Arcade FOOD HALL is also located across the street. Incredible amounts of resources are being invested into this area from the Bringing Back Broadway organization. Only signage allowed on Broadway is now NEON! <br/>
<br/>
GROUND FLOOR: Has SOARING CEILINGS!  There's CENTRAL HVAC along with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and a metal roll-up door for security. Space also has a back door to the alley, great for loading/unloading. Space can be used for any kind of permitted RETAIL SPACE or OFFICE SPACE. Space is IDEAL FOR AN ART GALLERY! Other great uses might be an barber shop, insurance agency, beauty salon, spa, clothing store, and more! Space has PRIVATE BATHROOM! There's also 3 OFFICES in the back! Smooth ceilings!<br/>
<br/>
BASEMENT: Basement is accessed through stairs in the ground floor space. It has raw brick walls, exposed wood ceilings, and cement flooring along with basic lighting. Technically, it can only be used for storage since there's only one staircase and it doesn't have an elevator. Doesn't have HVAC at the moment.<br/>

The biggest thing to come to Broadway in DECADES.  Brand new construction, this building isn't even finished being built yet!  Upstairs are condos for sale.  This listing is for the ground floor retail facing Broadway only, and not the only corner space or space facing 4th St, those are leased.  Amazingly beautiful space with soaring approximately 18 FOOT CEILINGS!  Space currently has cement flooring that can, of course, be polished, or have another flooring added.  Central HVAC is already installed.  Existing plumbing for a private bathroom is in place.  Space is build to suit, per negotiation, landlord can improve the space to meet ones needs.  Floor to ceiling windows flood this space with natural light.  This space is a block away from the famous Grand Central Market.  The building across the street is likely to be demolished to make way for another brand new development.  Around the block on 4th and Spring Street two brand new hotels are openning up, making this one of the most exciting blocks in Downtown LA.  There's infinite possibilities here. This prime retail space could be yours or your clients.  It's here now, but not for long. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY. We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn't meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does.

Beautiful ground floor space available FOR LEASE! This property is located in DTLA’s Fashion District in the famous Santee Passage (aka as Santee Court). So basically this space is behind the building on Los Angeles St in the courtyard, and this courtyard is where Santee St starts. There’s tons and tons of residents upstairs in multiple buildings! This is arguably the best area of the Fashion District and definitely the biggest residential hub in the Fashion District. 9th St and Los Angeles St is probably the most desirable area for showrooms as the Cooper Building is located there. This space is situated on Los Angeles St between 7th St and 8th St, and the Historic Core District, and all the amenities of the Historic Core, is only a few blocks away! So! Anyway this space is accessible from the side walk at the front end off Los Angeles St, shown in the photos. At this entrance there’s a food court and at the end of the passage a minim-mart. The other access point is from Santee Street. This space features windowed frontage, a front reception area, a conference room/office, a back open area with kitchenette, and a back private office. There’s also a storage closest. There’s built in desks that can be kept or removed, per negotiation. Excellent space with exposed ceilings, central HVAC, 24/7 access, great natural light, stylish glass walls, and more. This space shares a common area set of bathrooms on the second floor upstairs. Electricity not included. NNN/CAM INCLUDED!!! Rent rate applies for 1st year only, 2nd year is negotiable. This is a great price-per-square foot! Get it now before someone else swoops it up! Ask the advantages of signing a long lease! On all our listings MINIMAL ONE YEAR LEASE ARE ACCEPTED ONLY, and owner may require a longer than one-year lease for this listing. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY. We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn’t meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does!

Small GROUND FLOOR single-room retail space with WINDOWED FRONTAGE and SIGNAGE OPPORTUNITY. Exposed ceilings and LARGE BLACK POLISHED TILE FLOORING inside. The flooring is a bit slanted. This building is part of a large lot with a parking lot, parking upstairs, and another 13-story building on the Spring Street Side (parking not included). Located on MAIN STREET between 7th/8th St, this building gets a good amount of drive-by traffic and some walk-by traffic. It's right next to a brand new apartment development, and across the street soon-to-be-finished-renovating Dearden's Building.  It's really hard to ground floor retail space like this at this monthly rate! In fact, it's even hard to find ground floor retail space for $2000! It would be good for an office for no more than two people or a super small store of some kind.  There's already a mini-mart in the building, so no mini-marts allowed.  Space shares a common area restroom inside the parking garage. A/C options available.  24/7 ACCESS.  Get it before someone swoops it up!

Amazing and beautiful custom-built gym/studio wit IT ALL! A fortune has been spent on the improvements in this space!

Located on 7th Street &amp; Spring Street on Gallery Row, where most of the DTLA Artwalk occurs! Space has a RECEPTION AREA along with a desk, 2 ROOMS/OFFICES, two bathrooms, one with lockers and both with showers, and a HUGE OPEN FLOOR AREA!  There's beautiful polished cement floors throughout except in the bathrooms and studio area. The bathrooms have tile and the studio has nice high-end carpet.  There's 3 CENTRAL HVAC UNITS with private thermostats along with 24/7 ACCESS! This is an A+ location! Walking distance to tons of bars, cafes, &amp; restaurants! DTLA's newest FOOD HALL IS NOW OPEN on the ground floor of this building! There's also a COOl ROOF DECK with a GREAT VIEW! Get it now before someone else swoops it up! Ask advantages of signing 5-year lease! All our listings, min 1 year leases but owner may require longer than 1 year. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY.

Excellent amenities including a café on the 9th floor (Café 9), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the Crocker Club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. All white walls, and natural light. The building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. There’s also on-site management and maintenance. There’s shared men’s, women’s, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access.

This space is bank space/credit union space. DTLA RETAIL/OFFICE/MEDICAL SPACE for lease in the busy and well-known PROMENADE PLAZA! This property is located on the CORNER OF 1ST/HOPE ST right across the street from the DWP Building, Disney Hall, Music Center, and a block away from the mega Frank Gehry development that will soon be completed! This property is also a short walk to the soon to be completed new subway station! The property is a residential condo building upstairs known as the Promenade Towers and the retail below where the space is available is known again as the Promenade Plaza. Share the plaza with a great tenant mix including a Subway, a yoga studio, a cafe, an acupuncture &amp; herbal medicine office, a nail salon, a physical therapist and two restaurants! Unit 716 is a CORNER SPACE and has immediate visibility from the elevator from the parking garage.  As a corner space it gets natural light from two sides, and the unit has TONS OF WINDOWED FRONTAGE that could be used as advertising space.  It features it's on spot for signage and tons of outdoor seating available in the plaza.  This space was previously occupied by a CREDIT UNION so it's basically built out like a BANK SPACE.  The photos show the space as it is presently.  Another bank would be an excellent fit, but ANY PERMITTED USE IS POSSIBLE!  Per negotiation, landlord can deliver the space as an empty blank shell for a tenant wishing to use the space for a different use, such as medical office, dental office, and more. For well tenants who are well established and have excellent finances, landlord can, per negotiation, contribute to tenant improvements, aside from a basic demo.  It's also possible to subdivide the space into two units roughly 1100sf and 2000sf each.  The space currently has central HVAC, 2 private bathrooms, a server room, a lunch room, a teller station area, and a huge open area with divisions for desks.  Retail tenants have 24/7 access to the space and plaza. There’s a parking garage for the building as well where people can park for a daily fee of $10 of $200 monthly. It is also possible for retail tenants to validate their customers parking as well! Ask me the advantages of signing a five-year lease!

Incredible 12-story creative office building located on Gallery Row, in Downtown LA's Old Bank District, technically in the Historic Core. This building was originally home to the Crocker Bank and is positioned on Spring Street, the most popular street for creative types in DTLA, numbers-wise. This area is brimming with creative activity. Nearly countless bars, restaurants, and cafes dot the map nearby along with the post office across the street. The DTLA Art Walk (2nd Thursday of every month) occurs here on Spring Street, largely between 4th-8th Streets. The world famous night club The Exchange is a block away. This building is home to artists, fashion designers, attorneys, accountants, media, marketing/PR, and many more. There's also a hair salon and yoga studio in the building. Excellent amenities including a cafe on the 9th floor (Spring St Cafe), an incredibly beautiful bar made out of a bank vault in the basement (the Crocker Club), and a large conference room available on the third floor that is free for tenants to reserve. The building has 24/7 access and 24/7 on-site security. There's also on-site management and maintenance. There's shared mens, womens, and handicap restrooms on every floor along with a freight elevator with alley access. <br/>
<br/>
THIS IS THE COOLEST &amp; MOST UNIQUE SPACE IN THE BUILDING! And the biggest, for that matter.  Space has POLISHED CEMENT FLOORS along with GORGEOUS WINDOWS.  The space is a CORNER UNIT and the CONFERENCE ROOM (yes there is one) is in the corner.  Incredible picture frame wall and column molding give this space a historic, elegant look, and the raw brick and glass office walls lend itself to a HIGH TECH FEELING ENVIRONMENT.  There's AMAZING SKYLIGHTS that were discovered during renovation.  There's 7 PRIVATE OFFICES!  Reception area as well. Photos speak for themselves!  GREAT NATURAL LIGHT!  There is a HIDDEN SPEAK-EASY BAR/LUNCHROOM in the space as well, and it's complete with a kitchen, full bar, and refrigerator!  The bookshelf is a secret door!  Last but not least, there's a HUGE MEDIA ROOM as well along with an additional private room in there.  <br/>

The biggest thing to come to Broadway in DECADES.  Brand new construction, this building isn't even finished being built yet!  Upstairs are condos for sale.  This listing is for the ground floor retail facing Broadway only, and not the only corner space or space facing 4th St, those are leased.  Amazingly beautiful space with soaring approximately 18 FOOT CEILINGS!  Space currently has cement flooring that can, of course, be polished, or have another flooring added.  Central HVAC is already installed.  Existing plumbing for a private bathroom is in place.  Space is build to suit, per negotiation, landlord can improve the space to meet ones needs.  Floor to ceiling windows flood this space with natural light.  This space is a block away from the famous Grand Central Market.  The building across the street is likely to be demolished to make way for another brand new development.  Around the block on 4th and Spring Street two brand new hotels are openning up, making this one of the most exciting blocks in Downtown LA.  There's infinite possibilities here. This prime retail space could be yours or your clients.  It's here now, but not for long. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY. We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn't meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does.

Beautiful ground floor space available FOR LEASE! This property is located in DTLA’s Fashion District in the famous Santee Passage (aka as Santee Court). So basically this space is behind the building on Los Angeles St in the courtyard, and this courtyard is where Santee St starts. There’s tons and tons of residents upstairs in multiple buildings! This is arguably the best area of the Fashion District and definitely the biggest residential hub in the Fashion District. 9th St and Los Angeles St is probably the most desirable area for showrooms as the Cooper Building is located there. This space is situated on Los Angeles St between 7th St and 8th St, and the Historic Core District, and all the amenities of the Historic Core, is only a few blocks away! So! Anyway this space is accessible from the side walk at the front end off Los Angeles St, shown in the photos. At this entrance there’s a food court and at the end of the passage a minim-mart. The other access point is from Santee Street. This space features windowed frontage, a front reception area, a conference room/office, a back open area with kitchenette, and a back private office. There’s also a storage closest. There’s built in desks that can be kept or removed, per negotiation. Excellent space with exposed ceilings, central HVAC, 24/7 access, great natural light, stylish glass walls, and more. This space shares a common area set of bathrooms on the second floor upstairs. Electricity not included. NNN/CAM INCLUDED!!! Rent rate applies for 1st year only, 2nd year is negotiable. This is a great price-per-square foot! Get it now before someone else swoops it up! Ask the advantages of signing a long lease! On all our listings MINIMAL ONE YEAR LEASE ARE ACCEPTED ONLY, and owner may require a longer than one-year lease for this listing. Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY. We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn’t meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does!

This building is part of a large lot with a parking lot, parking upstairs, and another 13-story building on the Spring Street Side (parking not included).

It's right next to a brand new apartment development, and across the street soon-to-be-finished-renovating Dearden's Building.  It's really hard to ground floor retail space like this at this monthly rate! In fact, it's even hard to find ground floor retail space for $2000! It would be good for an office for no more than two people or a super small store of some kind.  There's already a mini-mart in the building, so no mini-marts allowed.  Space shares a common area restroom inside the parking garage. A/C options available.  24/7 ACCESS.  Get it before someone swoops it up!

</div>
NEWLY RENOVATED RESTAURANT SPACE FOR LEASE in SOUTH PASADENA! The famous Rialto Theater has had a phenomenal facelift and the retail has undergone an amazing RENOVATION! This stunning space has been freshly cleaned up and painted. The ceilings are an estimated 18′ HIGH CEILINGS with large windows stretching to the ceiling! MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF NATURAL LIGHT flood this space, and what a BEAUTIFUL SPACE it is. It features an existing functioning VENT/HOOD along with multiple sinks. There’s a countertop that opens from the kitchen/cooking area right into the space. INFINITE POSSIBILITIES for restaurant/café spaces for this space. Located in an EXCELLENT LOCATION with TONS OF DRIVE-BY TRAFFIC! As far as permits go, due diligence has yet to have been done regarding whether they are active or not. Yet, for qualified Lessee’s Lessor may consider a free rent period if any permit work is needed. Space features an ADA size bathroom (Lessee to verify) along with a small bathroom in the kitchen. There’s a second floor storage area as well that’s approximately 120sf, and is included in the quoted rent rate. I imagine a restaurant/café concept that does a lot of take-out and delivery would find this opportunity the most attractive since there is limited space for seating. Get it before someone else comes and takes this hot opportunity off the market! Showings by APPOINTMENT ONLY! We are a real estate brokerage, if this space doesn’t meet your needs we may have or know about something else that does! Please call/text 213-304-4727 now! Thank you!
