<div class=""print-qrcode"" data-location=""https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/apa/d/los-angeles-charming-bedroom-bathroom/7326047317.html""></div>
</div>
the unit is a side unit addition to the main house. the unit has its own private entry, parking space with gate (featured in photos) and only shares one wall with the main house. there is a shared laundry and dryer on site.<br/>
<br/>
renters in the side unit would live as neighbors to us (we are also renters and live in the main house). we are a couple in our 30's with a 2 year old boy. we love the location, space, and having our family here. we are looking for a single person (or couple) who will be a respectful and friendly neighbor and easy to communicate with about our shared space. the property is smoke free (cigarettes). <br/>
<br/>
the side unit for rent has one large living room with a large closet, full bathroom, and kitchen, and one large bedroom with: 2 closets, a private full bathroom, and a side nook with a window which could be used for a office/desk.  it's very spacious for a single person but has been occupied by a couple as well.  the property as a whole has a front and back yard, with lovely trees and flowers.  the photo's featured have the current tenants belongings. the space is not furnished. <br/>
<br/>
located in a prime area of highland park, this side unit is on a quiet residential street, but is extremely close to shops/coffee/yoga/bars/highland park theater on figueroa st. it is also a short walk (1/2 mile) to the gold line metro and dash bus. it is 10 minutes to downtown by car and less than 15 minutes by train. we use the train all the time.  additionally, ernest debs regional park is right in our backyard and only a short walk to the trails up the hills of the park. <br/>
<br/>
rent for the side unit is $1850 per month (+ 1 month deposit). this does not include utilities, which are split between the main house and side unit. the unit is available for move-in july 1st, but could be made available sooner if needed. <br/>
<br/>
please email with a little bit of information about yourself, including what type of living situation you are looking for, what you do for work in los angeles, your age, and whether or not you are seeking the unit for yourself or as a couple. let us know if you have any questions. we will email you back to set up a time to view the unit.<br/>

</div>
hey y'all!<br/>
<br/>
looking to fill a room in a great apartment in montecito heights starting june 1st. 1 year lease preferred.<br/>
<br/>
about the apartment: <br/>
- 3br/2ba<br/>
- lower level, off-street unit in a 3 unit triplex <br/>
- fully remodeled in 2018 with new flooring, appliances, and fixtures<br/>
- 1 group of tenants since remodel<br/>
- high ceilings, tons of natural light<br/>
- 3 off-street parking spots<br/>
- central ac/heating<br/>
- large outdoor space (currently with picnic table, potted garden, and grill) <br/>
- friendly, quiet neighbors<br/>
<br/>
about the room:<br/>
rent: $900/mo + wifi/utilities ($60-90/mo depending on ac use)<br/>
- 12’ x 9’<br/>
- larger of the two secondary bedrooms<br/>
- nw facing windows w/ abundant afternoon light<br/>
- bathroom shared with one person<br/>
<br/>
pros:<br/>
- 12 mins to usc's health sciences campus (lac+usc, keck hospital) at all hours <br/>
- great offsite landlord who promptly responds to issues<br/>
- pet friendly! 2 friendly cats in residence currently, will consider additional pets<br/>
- 5 minutes to bars/eateries in highland park on figueroa <br/>
- a short walk to: debs regional park, sycamore grove park, and a large grocery store<br/>
close to the 110: short drive to pasadena, dtla, echo park, and silver lake<br/>
<br/>
cons:<br/>
- no washer/dryer. however, there is a laundromat a 1/2 block away so if you can make the trek this place might be for you. <br/>
<br/>
about the roommates:<br/>
#1: 29 year old medical student at usc. i work a lot and like the home to be a place a relax and recharge, and occasionally host a few friends. when not working i like getting outdoors to hike, ski, hit the beach, or golf. always searching for the next great la sandwich. recently tried: the blta at spoke bicycle cafe, highly recommended.<br/>
<br/>
#2: early 30s attorney. i like to run, hike, and be active. i work both at home and in the office but am quiet. i'm always up for trying out a new brewery, restaurant, or attempting a new recipe. i have 2 friendly cats.<br/>
<br/>
about you:<br/>
- organized with your bills (i.e. employed or student)<br/>
- generally respectful of personal space and others' work schedules<br/>
- not an aspiring dj after 10pm at night<br/>
<br/>
if you're interested please send an email with a bit about yourself. if it seems like a good match we'll reach out to set up a showing. thanks!<br/>
<br/>
happy to send a video tour or additional pics of the home in its lived-in state, if desired.    </section>", (Montecito Heights),$900,3.0,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-room-available-in-3br-2ba/7325583167.html,34.093998,-118.207612,POINT (-118.207612 34.093998),art,True

hello, the room will be opening june 1st, and is located in a beautiful and picturesque highland park hill-house complete with views and private outdoor space/collective parking. <br/>
<br/>
the room itself is long and large enough to be both a bedroom and a music studio (that's what i did there for a year), and has it's own entrance, outside hang area, 1/2 bath. and of course comes along with access to the amazing house with central heat/ac, private outdoor space (a small putting green), washer dryer, and views a plenty. the other two housemates are two male songwriters/artists in their 30's, live upstairs from the studio, and are respectful and cleanly. <br/>
<br/>
1700$ a month plus utilities, first and deposit due up front. open to shorter stays but would prefer someone looking for a year lease to start.    </section>", (Highland Park),"$1,700",3.0,300.0,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-huge-bedroom-studio-with/7324949419.html,34.1145,-118.1929,POINT (-118.1929 34.1145),private,True

</div>
about the room:<br/>
the room has a large closet and two windows. you will be sharing a bathroom with another roommate (she is very clean and respectful). please note the room will not be furnished. there is a 6-month minimum lease, which will then roll over to month-to-month.<br/>
<br/>
about the house:<br/>
the house is a 3br/2ba craftsman in the heart of highland park. there is a washer/dryer in the unit and plenty of parking on the residential streets (not at all like hollywood where parking is a nightmare). the house is fully furnished but please note, the room itself is unfurnished. there is also a separate guest house in the back where there is also a tenant - so a total of three rooms in the house and one more in the separate back house.<br/>
<br/>
location<br/>
we are located 1 block from the popular york blvd where there are plenty of shops, restaurants, and nightlife. there is a supermarket called super a, a 5 min walk away. there is also a trader joe’s, sprouts, target and vons about a 5 min drive away. we are also 5 mins from figueroa st and colorado blvd where there are plenty of shops, restaurants, etc.<br/>
<br/>
current roommates:<br/>
we are women in our early-mid 30s. our careers vary from bioresearch to film. we all work full time and both work remotely and onsite at this point (we are also fully vaccinated! woo!) a must for any new addition is that they are drama-free, reliable with bills and respectful of communal spaces as we have a very harmonious environment in the house.<br/>
<br/>
pets:<br/>
there is a 12lb senior dog in the guest house and a 35lb dog in the house so you must be dog-friendly. they are both calm, well behaved, and trained. but unfortunately, we cannot have any additional pets.    </section>", (Highland Park),"$1,200",,,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/d/los-angeles-bedroom-available-in/7322036386.html,34.1145,-118.1929,POINT (-118.1929 34.1145),art,True
